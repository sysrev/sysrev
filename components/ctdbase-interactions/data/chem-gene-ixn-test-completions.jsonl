PGs are fatty acid mediators involved in cartilage homeostasis, however the action of their synthesizing COX-enzymes in cartilage differentiation is not well understood. In this study we hypothesized that COX-1 and COX-2 have differential roles in chondrogenic differentiation.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionThe chondrogenic differentiation process is accompanied by a stage-dependent expression of important chondrogenic markers: Sox9 (SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9) is a primary determinant of chondrogenic differentiation from early differentiation stage onwards [, ], while its transcriptional targets; collagen type 2 (Col2a1) and aggrecan (Acan) are prominently expressed by more mature, extracellular matrix (ECM) producing chondrocytes. On the other hand, Collagen type 10 (Col10a1) and its transcription factor Runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) are specifically expressed by hypertrophic differentiating chondrocytes [, ]. Cyclooxygenases, also known as prostaglandin H synthases, are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, a rate-limiting step in the generation of prostaglandins [, ]. Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) is converted by specific synthases to the main prostaglandin subgroups PGD2, PGE2, PGI2, PGF2\\u03b1 and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which can be converted into various other intermediates [, ]. To date three COX isoforms have been described: COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3. The first two are the most prevalent and best described isoforms []. The COX-3 isoform is a splice variant of COX-1; however there is much debate on the function of COX-3 [\\u2013]. Both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms catalyse the same enzymatic reactions and are structurally related []. They have remarkable differences regarding their tissue distribution, expression levels and their ability to respond to various stimuli [, , ]. COX-1 is constitutively expressed by most mammalian cells and regarded as the \\u201chousekeeping\\u201d cyclooxygenase. On the other hand, COX-2 expression is low in most tissues but can be rapidly induced upon exposure to various stimuli such as inflammation, mechanical stress and injury [, ] due to inducible enhancer elements in its promoter [].\\n\\nStudies investigating the roles of cyclooxygenases and the effects of prostaglandins on (in vitro) chondrogenic differentiation have mainly focussed on COX-2 (inhibition) and PGE2 [\\u2013]. However, the contribution of COX-1 and other prostaglandins in chondrogenic differentiation is largely ignored. Given their different roles in cellular prostaglandin synthesis, it is not unlikely that the two COX enzymes are differently involved in determining the outcome of the chondrogenic differentiation process.\\n\\nWe have previously shown that COX-2 expression is transiently upregulated during the first hours in chondrogenic differentiation of progenitor cells [] and a second time later in differentiation, when its expression coincidences with chondrocyte extracellular matrix synthesis []. In addition, we found that inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity results in a reduction of the hypertrophy outcome of the chondrogenic differentiation process []. However, whether this observation is specific for COX-2 and how this relates to COX-1 activity and specific prostaglandin involvement is unclear.\\n\\nWe hypothesized that COX-1 and COX-2 have differential roles in the chondrogenic differentiation process of progenitor cells and that their specific inhibition will thereby differently influence the outcome of the differentiation process. The characterisation of the function of the COX-enzymes and prostaglandins holds the promise to gain a deeper understanding of the chondrogenic differentiation process and thereby may uncover novel chances to influence cartilage tissue regeneration.\\n\\nMethodsImmunohistochemistryGrowth plates were isolated from tibias of 6 weeks old C57BL\\\/6 mice (approved by the local Animal Ethics Committee according to Dutch law; MUMC DEC approval 2008\\u2013042). Mice were euthanized using O2\\\/CO2 asphyxiation. The tibias were fixed in formalin and decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) pH 7.8. Tibias were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and five micrometer sections were cut. Sections were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval for COX-1 sections was performed by digestion with 0.4% hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. For COX-2 detection, sections were incubated in hot citrate buffer for 30 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated and sections were blocked with 10% normal sheep serum. Primary antibodies (anti-COX-1 (160110, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, USA) and anti-COX-2 (610203, BD Transduction Laboratories)) were used in 1:100 dilution in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline). After washing in PBS-Tween20, bound antibodies were detected with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-labelled secondary antibodies (Dako, EnVision+ System-HRP labelled Polymer). Bound secondary antibodies were visualized using DAB substrate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Stained sections were counterstained with Mayer\\u2019s Hematoxylin (Dako), dehydrated and mounted in Histomount (Thermo Shandon).\\n\\nATDC5 cultureATDC5 cells [] (RIKEN Cell Bank, Japan) were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Proliferation medium consisted of DMEM (Dulbecco\\u2019s modified eagle medium)\\\/F12 (Life Technologies, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), 5% FCS (fetal calf serum) (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 1% antibiotic\\\/antimycotic (Penicillin\\\/Streptomycin; Life Technologies) and 1% NEAA (non-essential amino acids; Life Technologies). Differentiation medium comprised proliferation medium supplemented with 10 \\u03bcg\\\/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 \\u03bcg\\\/ml transferrin (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and 30 nM sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were plated at 6400 cells\\\/cm2. Differentiation medium was changed every two days (day 0\\u201310) and daily (from day 10 onwards). To inhibit COX-1 activity SC-560 (1 \\u03bcM; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, USA) or Mofezolac (5 \\u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) were used and applied during the differentiation process. Similarly, COX-2 activity was inhibited by NS398 (20 \\u03bcM; Cayman Chemical) or Celecoxib (10 \\u03bcM; LC laboratories). PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\\u03b1 and U-46619 (a TXA2 receptor agonist, herein referred to as TXA2) (Cayman Chemical) were applied daily during the differentiation process at 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 \\u03bcM concentrations. These concentrations were selected in the range of the highest concentrations reported in the culture supernatants of control differentiated t = 14 days ATDC5 cells. PGI2 (from the same manufacturer) was not applied in these experiments, as it is unstable in culture medium and therefore could not be used in a reliable manner.\\n\\nProstaglandin measurementProstaglandin concentration of PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 was determined in culture supernatants using ELISA\\u2019s according to the manufacturers\\u2019 protocol (Cayman Chemical). PGI2 concentrations could not be determined in a reliable manner by the ELISA\\u2019s from the same manufacturer and was therefore not included in these experiments.\\n\\nCOX specificity assayThe colorimetric COX inhibitor screening assay kit (Cayman Chemical) was used according to the manufacturers\\u2019 protocol to determine COX isoform-specific inhibitory capacity for SC-560, Mofezolac, NS398 and Celecoxib.\\n\\nRT-qPCRFor RNA isolation, cells were disrupted with 300 \\u03bcl Trizol (Life Technologies). RNA isolation, RNA quantification by UV-spectrometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific), and cDNA synthesis were performed as described before [, ]. Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using Mesagreen qPCR mastermix plus for SYBR\\u00ae Green (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). A CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection system (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for amplification: initial denaturation at 95\\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of DNA amplification (denaturing for 15 seconds at 95\\u00b0C and annealing for 1 minute at 60\\u00b0C) followed by a dissociation curve. Data were analysed using the standard curve method, mRNA expression was normalized to a reference gene (\\u03b2-actin) and gene expression was calculated as fold change compared to day 0 (t = 0 in graphs). Validated primer sequences are depicted in .\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0153162.t001Table 1Primer sequences for RT-qPCR.Oligo setsForwardReverseCollagen type 2

The main route of exposure to PCBs is through the gastrointestinal tract; however, little is known about the effects of PCBs on intestinal epithelial barrier functions.\",\"full-text\":\"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most persistent and widespread environmental pollutants today. Currently, the amount of PCBs globally distributed throughout the environment is estimated at > 1.5 million metric tons (), and their bioaccumulation and bioconcentration in the food chain are well established. Indeed, the primary route of PCB exposure for most of the population is through dietary intake, with high-fish-consuming populations being at higher risk (). Studies performed on population cohorts in the Great Lakes region consistently report that individuals with high fish consumption have a higher PCB body burden that may be related to the alterations of prenatal and postnatal cognitive development, behavior, and childhood IQ (; ).\\n\\nVery little is known about the effects of PCBs on the gastrointestinal (GI) system. We propose that exposure to PCBs through diet may influence individual health outcome via alterations of tight junctions (TJs) that seal together the adjacent intestinal epithelial cells, leading to increased intestinal permeability. The small intestine is characterized by the presence of villi that contain epithelium, which functions as a highly dynamic and selective barrier between the outside environment and underlying tissue. TJs consist of an intricate combination of transmembrane (e.g., occludin) and cytoplasmic accessory proteins [e.g., zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)] linked to the actin cytoskeleton. The function of TJs depends on the proper expression and localization of these proteins. For example, regional loss of occludin in the intestinal epithelium was noted in an experimental model of jaundice-induced gut barrier dysfunction (), and a decrease in ZO-1 expression was observed in hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (). Loss of GI epithelial integrity has been associated with the pathogenesis of several acute and chronic diseases, including diabetes, allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases ().\\n\\nThe mechanisms of cellular and tissue toxicity of PCBs are not fully understood. However, PCBs are potent activators of oxidative stress; therefore, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be one of the mechanisms contributing to gut dysfunction. Recent evidence implicates NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) as an important source of ROS (). Active NOX generates superoxide via one electron transfer from NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) or NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Excessive activation of NOX has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory tissue injury and disease ().\\n\\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the hypothesis that PCBs can disrupt gut integrity at the level of TJs. Mechanistically, our studies focused on the role of PCBs in activation of prooxidative NOX. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we investigated whether exposure to individual PCB congeners can disrupt integrity of the intestinal epithelium via NOX-mediated disruption of TJ proteins.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsCell culture and PCB treatmentCaco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were cultured in GlutaMax medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 U\\\/mL penicillin G, 100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 12 hr before treatment with PCB (1\\u201310 \\u03bcM) or vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); control]. For NOX inhibition experiments, Caco-2 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 0.5 mM apocynin (Invitrogen), followed by exposure to individual PCB congeners. PCB126 (3,3\\u2032,4,4\\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl), PCB153 (2,2\\u2032,4,4\\u2032,5,5\\u2032-hexachlorobiphenyl), PCB104 (2,2\\u2032,4,6,6\\u2032-pentachlorobiphenyl), and PCB118 (2,3\\u2032,4,4\\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl) were purchased from AccuStandard (New Haven, CT).\\n\\nWe used PCBs at concentrations of 1\\u201310 \\u03bcM, with 5 \\u03bcM used in most experiments. Such concentrations of PCBs do not affect cell viability () and reflect serum PCB levels in acutely exposed human populations (3.4 \\u03bcM or 1 ppm) (; ).\\n\\nTransepithelial permeability and NOX activity assaysCells were seeded at high density (2 \\u00d7 105 cells\\\/cm2) on fibronectin-coated Transwell tissue culture inserts (12 mm diameter, 0.4 \\u03bcm pore size; Costar, Corning, NY). We assessed the transepithelial transfer of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran of 4 kDa molecular weight (FD-4; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as described previously (), after cells achieved confluence and established transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values of 200\\u2013250 \\u03a9 \\u00d7 cm2.\\n\\nNOX activity was evaluated by a lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method as described previously by . Intensity of chemiluminescence was measured using MikroWin2000 software and a CenrtoXS3 LB 960 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN).\\n\\nImmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescenceImmunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (). Protein lysates were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE precast gels, electrophoresed (120 V, 1 hr), and transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (0.2 \\u03bcm) at 200 mAmp for 2 hr. Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated in respective primary antibody (1:500 dilution) overnight at 4\\u00b0C. We obtained anti-ZO-1 and anti-occludin antibodies from Zymed Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA); anti-phospho-p47phox antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); and anti-gp91phox (gp91 subunit) and anti-p47phox (p47 subunit) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The next day, membranes were washed and incubated with species-specific horseradish peroxidase\\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Proteins of interest were detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and semiquantitated with UN-SCAN-IT gel (Silk Scientific Corp., Orem, UT, USA).\\n\\nFor immunofluorescence, cultures were fixed with ice-cold 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 10% goat serum (Sigma). Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C with primary antibody diluted (1:100) in TBS. Cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Texas red\\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 hr at 25\\u00b0C. Images were viewed using a confocal microscope under identical instrument settings.\\n\\nAnimalsAll animal protocols in this study were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the University of Kentucky. The animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. Male C57BL\\\/6 mice (12\\u201314 weeks of age; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed under 12:12 hr light:dark conditions with access to food and water ad libitum. Animals were fasted overnight before PCB treatment (150 \\u03bcmol\\\/kg). The 150-\\u03bcmol\\\/kg dose results in plasma PCB levels of 5 \\u03bcM, reflecting the concentration that was used in vitro. Individual PCB congeners were dissolved in tocopherol-stripped safflower oil (Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA) and administered in a 0.1-mL volume via oral gavage using an 18-gauge gavage needle, 3 in. long, curved, 2.25 mm ball diameter (Popper and Sons, New Hyde Park, NY). Control animals received safflower oil vehicle. Mice were either sacrificed for tissue analysis or used in intestinal permeability experiments 24 hr after PCB or vehicle treatment.\\n\\nIntestinal permeabilityWe assessed gut permeability as described by . Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and administered FITC-dextran [20 kDa (FD-20); 22 mg\\\/kg body weight in 100 \\u03bcL phosphate-buffered saline] via oral gavage. Blood samples were collected at 1, 3, and 5 hr after FD-20 administration. Plasma concentrations of FD-20 were determined at 485 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission).\\n\\nImmunohistochemistryAnalyses were performed on 1\\u20133 cm gastroduodenal segments, which were fixed in 10% (vol\\\/vol) formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (6 \\u03bcm) using a Finesse microtome (Shandon Cryotome, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained using an adaptation of previously described methods ().\\n\\nStatistical analysisWe used SigmaStat 2.0 software (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA) for statistical analysis. Comparisons between treatments were made by one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey\\u2019s pairwise multiple comparison procedure. Statistical probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant.\\n\\nResultsIndividual PCB congeners induce NOX activity via phosphorylation of the p47 subunitWe investigated the hypothesis whether NOX-mediated reactions are involved in PCB-induced cellular toxicity. We exposed Caco-2 cells to individual PCB congeners at the concentration of 5 \\u03bcM and assessed NOX activity using the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay. All measurements were performed at the same time, immediately after the end of PCB exposure. As illustrated in , a 5-min exposure to all studied PCBs resulted in a significant increase in NOX activity by approximately 40%. However, NOX activity was similar to control values after treatment with PCBs for 15 or 30 min.\\n\\nAssembly of the active NOX complex is associated with phosphorylation of the p47 subunit and its translocation from the cytosol into the membrane fraction. Therefore, we measured p47 phosphorylation after PCB treatm\n\nRespond with a JSON array of objects in this format:

The signaling mechanisms that control CMA are not fully understood but might involve response to stress conditions including oxidative stress. Considering the role of CMA in redoxtasis and proteostasis, we sought to determine if the transcription factor NFE2L2\\\/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2) has an impact on CMA modulation. In this work, we identified and validated 2 NFE2L2 binding sequences in the LAMP2 gene and demonstrated in several human and mouse cell types that NFE2L2 deficiency and overexpression was linked to reduced and increased LAMP2A levels, respectively. Accordingly, lysosomal LAMP2A levels were drastically reduced in nfe2l2-knockout hepatocytes, which also displayed a marked decrease in CMA activity. Oxidant challenge with paraquat or hydrogen peroxide, or pharmacological activation of NFE2L2 with sulforaphane or dimethyl fumarate also increased LAMP2A levels and CMA activity. Overall, our study identifies for the first time basal and inducible regulation of LAMP2A, and consequently CMA activity, by NFE2L2.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionIntracellular oxidized proteins can be eliminated by a selective type of autophagy termed chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The main characteristic of this mode of autophagy is the presence of a lysosomal receptor called LAMP2A (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A). Soluble cytosolic proteins bearing a KFERQ-like motif are recognized by HSPA8\\\/HSC70 (heat shock protein family A [Hsp70] member 8) [\\u2013]. HSPA8 delivers cargoes to the lysosome surface, where they interact with LAMP2A []. Then, LAMP2A multimerizes in the lysosomal membrane to form a translocation complex [], so that unfolded substrates can enter the lysosome, assisted by lumenal HSPA8, and eventually be degraded by lysosomal proteases [,]. The limiting step in the whole process appears to be the availability of LAMP2A receptor at the lysosomal membrane, as lysosomal LAMP2A levels have been reported to correlate with CMA activity, and knockdown or overexpression of LAMP2A results in a decrease or increase in CMA proportional to the levels of expression [,]. LAMP2A is one of the 3 proteins that originate from alternative splicing of the LAMP2 gene. All LAMP2A, LAMP2B and LAMP2C isoforms share an identical lumenal region but differ in their cytosolic and transmembrane tail []. These isoforms result from cell-specific yet unknown regulation of differential splicing [,] but experimental evidence supports the conclusion that LAMP2A is the only LAMP2 variant required for CMA [,].\\n\\nAlthough basal CMA activity can be detected in most cell types [], this process is maximally activated in response to stress. Activation of CMA is associated with increased levels of LAMP2A and its multimerization to form membrane translocation complexes, lysosomal enrichment in HSPA8 and relocation of lysosomes to the perinuclear region [\\u2013]. It has been reported that a mild oxidant environment activates the expression of Lamp2a [] and that this process is under the transcriptional regulation of NFAT in T cells []. However, a generic mechanism that might regulate the expression of LAMP2A under these circumstances remains unknown.\\n\\nNFE2L2\\\/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2), participates in the control of metabolic redox processes including degradation of oxidized proteins. NFE2L2 controls the basal and stress-inducible expression of over 250 genes that share a common a cis-acting enhancer termed the antioxidant response element (ARE) []. These genes participate in several cytoprotective functions such as phase I, II and III detoxification reactions, glutathione and PRDX\\\/peroxiredoxin-TXN\\\/thioredoxin metabolism, NADPH production through the pentose phosphate pathway and ME (malic enzyme), fatty acid oxidation or iron metabolism []. Most of these reactions provide an armamentarium to control redox homeostasis. Importantly for this study, we and others previously reported that NFE2L2 can modulate the expression of several genes involved in macroautophagy [\\u2013]. Thus, we identified many NFE2L2-regulated genes involved in the different phases of the macroautophagy process, from cargo recognition to autolysosome clearance []. Considering this evidence and the role of CMA in the cellular response to oxidative stress [], it might be feasible that NFE2L2 also participates in the regulation of CMA, but this possibility has not yet been investigated.\\n\\nIn this study, we show for the first time that NFE2L2 is required for CMA activation through the transcriptional control of LAMP2A expression, revealing a molecular pathway that connects oxidative stress with CMA induction. Bearing in mind that oxidized proteins accumulate in aging and in several age-related pathological conditions [], when CMA activity has been shown to decline [,], this study provides a new strategy to activate CMA through NFE2L2 inducers to facilitate elimination of such damaged and otherwise toxic proteins.\\n\\nResultsNFE2L2 binds to functional antioxidant response elements (ares) in the LAMP2 geneWe searched the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements at UCSC (ENCODE) [] of the human genome for putative AREs in this gene (Figure 1a). The ENCODE database gathers experimental data from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of ARE binding transcription factors MAFF, MAFK and BACH1 although NFE2L2 is not analyzed. As shown in , some of these binding sites were located at histone acetylated and DNAse-sensitive regions in the LAMP2 gene, both factors being typical of active enhancers. We then used a Python-based bioinformatics analysis to scan these binding regions for the consensus ARE as established in the JASPAR database []. We detected 8 putative AREs in the LAMP2 gene (Table S1) and 3 of them showed a relative score higher than 85%, a commonly used threshold for transcription factor binding-site analysis [,]. Moreover, the analysis also retrieved already identified AREs in the bona fide target genes of NFE2L2, HMOX1 and SQSTM1\\\/p62 ().10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-T0001Table 1.Putative antioxidant response elements (AREs) with a relative score higher than the 85% in the LAMP2 gene.\\n\\nARELocalization of the potential AREMax ScoreRelative scorePutative binding sequenceRegion of the geneARE1chrX:119,596,430\\u2013119,596,44115.830.921ATGACACTGCAIntron 1ARE2chrX:119 619,599\\u2013119,619,61013.240.859TTGACTCAGCG5\\u02b9 UTR (\\u221216,500)ARE3chrX:119,619,560\\u2013119,619,57113.070.855ATGACAAACCA5\\u02b9 UTR (\\u221216,500)\\n10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-F0001Figure 1.NFE2L2 binds to 2 functional antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the LAMP2 gene.

These regions were localized in 200\\u2013400 base-pair-long DNAse-sensitive and H3K27Ac-rich regions, i.e. most likely regulatory promoter regions.

The figure shows representative data normalized as the fold of enrichment with the anti-V5 antibody vs. the IgG antibody.

The molecular mechanisms that connect air pollution with brain pathology are largely unknown but seem to depend on the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter (PM). We sourced ambient PM from Riverside, California, and selectively exposed rats to coarse (PM 2.5-10 : 2.5-10\\u2009\\u00b5m), fine (PM <2.5 : <2.5\\u2009\\u00b5m), or ultrafine particles (UFPM: <0.15\\u2009\\u00b5m). We characterized each PM type via atomic emission spectroscopy and detected nickel, cobalt and zinc within them. We then exposed rats separately to each PM type for short (2 weeks), intermediate (1-3 months) and long durations (1 year). All three metals accumulated in rat brains during intermediate-length PM exposures. Via RNAseq analysis we then determined that intermediate-length PM 2.5-10  exposures triggered the expression of the early growth response gene 2 (EGR2), genes encoding inflammatory cytokine pathways (IL13-R\\u03b11 and IL-16) and the oncogene RAC1. Gene upregulation occurred only in brains of rats exposed to PM 2.5-10  and correlated with cerebral nickel accumulation. We hypothesize that the expression of inflammation and oncogenesis-related genes is triggered by the combinatorial exposure to certain metals and toxins in Los Angeles Basin PM 2.5-10 .\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionAir pollution leads to well-documented cardiovascular and respiratory problems,, brain cancer,\\u00a0and neurological disorders including strokes, Alzheimer\\u2019s, and Parkinson\\u2019s disease\\u2013. To better understand the biological mechanisms that underlie pollution-associated brain disorders, we must identify disease causing components in air pollution mixtures; these include gases, particulate matter (PM), trace metals, and organic compounds. We focus on the synergistic interplay between PM, trace metals and toxins in Los Angeles Basin ambient air pollution.\\n\\nIn humans, exposures to high levels of air pollution are associated with chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration,. Brain tissue samples from individuals residing in Mexico City contained increased numbers of infiltrating monocytes, activated microglia, increased expression of interleukin 1 beta, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, endothelial cell activation and prefrontal cortical lesions,. Moreover, increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers, deposits of alpha-synuclein, amyloid beta protein and hyper-phosphorylated tau protein, collectively indicative of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, have been documented in brains from urban residents,\\u2013.\\n\\nAnimals show similar responses to air pollution. Mexico City stray dogs had elevated concentrations of vanadium and nickel in cortical and olfactory bulb neurons. Amyloid beta protein depositions were also detected. Experimentally, it has been shown that prolonged exposures to diesel exhaust cause neuroinflammation in rats, while nanoscale PM from Los Angeles urban traffic induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the olfactory epithelium and the brain. Exposure to vehicle exhaust also increases anxiety and depression-like behaviors in rats, and accelerates plaque formation in a mouse model of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\\n\\nIn the present study, airborne PM were defined as either coarse (PM2.5\\u201310: 2.5\\u201310\\u2009\\u03bcm), fine (PM<2.5: <2.5\\u2009\\u03bcm) or ultrafine particulate matter (UFPM: <0.25\\u2009\\u03bcm). PM<2.5 also contained UFPM. Each type of PM has a distinct composition and mediates different effects on organ health. UFPM deposit deep in the lungs and are small enough to cross epithelial barriers into the circulation. From there, UFPM can impact distal organs, including the heart and brain, and enter intracellular compartments to disrupt normal cell function,. Coarse PM, on the other hand, deposit via inertial impactation in the upper respiratory system and may be partially removed via mucociliary clearance or ingestion\\\/sequestration in lymphoid and intestinal tissues. Coarse particles probably do not enter the circulatory system directly, but trace metals, endotoxins and other soluble compounds present on coarse PM can leach into the fluid lining of the airways. Leached metals trigger the production of reactive oxygen species via Fenton-like reactions and soluble toxins can activate molecular signaling cascades that trigger tissue inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, monocytes and macrophages are subsequently released into the systemic circulation, and if sustained, can trigger BBB damage,, nervous system inflammation and the expression of cancer-related genes in brain tissue. Many studies that have investigated PM effects on organ health defined PM10, as per regulation, as any particulate matter sized \\u226410\\u2009\\u03bcm. PM10 therefore also contains PM<2.5 and UFPM. To better understand how individual PM types affect our health, it is instructive to separate the coarse and fine particles. We used a material impactor to separate coarse from fine PM and then fractionated the fine PM into PM<2.5 and UFPM aerosols. Therefore, PM2.5\\u201310 in our study contains only 2.5\\u201310\\u2009\\u03bcm sized particles.\\n\\nBelow we describe our observations on the association between toxic metals found in different PM types with the expression of inflammation and oncogenes in rat brains. Atomic emission spectroscopy was first used to analyze the metal contents of PM2.5\\u201310, PM<2.5 and UFPM in ambient air from the Los Angeles Basin. We then exposed rats for short (2 weeks), intermediate (1\\u20133 months) and long (1 year) time periods separately to each PM type. We demonstrate that intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 and UFPM lead to cerebral metal accumulation. However, upregulation of inflammation and tumorigenesis biomarkers was only observed following exposures to PM2.5\\u201310, not UFPM. We explain this finding by comparing the unique toxicological profiles of PM2.5\\u201310 and UFPM; both contain metals, but only PM2.5\\u201310 specifically correlates with ambient endotoxin concentrations in Southern California,. This suggests that combinatorial exposures to multiple toxins are necessary to trigger certain molecular events that precede inflammation and tumorigenesis.\\n\\nResultsWe exposed rats separately to either PM2.5\\u201310, PM<2.5, UFPM or filtered air. Via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), we first analyzed the metal content of our PM samples and then asked if these metals accumulated in the brains of rats that were exposed to PM.\\n\\nSix metals, namely cadmium, cobalt, lead, nickel, vanadium, and zinc, were detected via ICP-AES in our PM samples. Only nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), lead, and zinc (Zn) were identifiable in all types of PM (Table\\u00a0). The Ni content ranged from 0.0025 to 0.012\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3, the Co content from 0.0016 to 0.0037\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3, the lead content from 0.0023 to 0.034\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3, and the Zn content from 0.042 to 0.265\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3 (Table\\u00a0).

The Ni content remained approximately constant over 12 months (Fig.\\u00a0), but the Co content increased significantly after 12 months of exposures to filtered air (Fig.\\u00a0; ANOVA: F(2,9)\\u2009=\\u200932.35, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001).

These results demonstrate that a certain amount of heavy metal accumulation (Co) and clearance (Zn) occurs in the absence of targeted PM exposures. We next compare metal contents in the brains of rats exposed to concentrated ambient PM vs. filtered air.Figure 1Metal content in rat brains after exposures to filtered air.

Morroniside (Mor) of  Cornus officinalis  and diosgenin (Dio) of  Dioscorea opposita  formed an innovative formula named M + D. The aims of the present study were to investigate myocardial protective effect of M + D on diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) through the inhibition of expression levels of caspase-3 protein, and identify the advantage of M + D compared with Mor, Dio, and the positive drug metformin (Met). We detected cell viability, cell apoptosis, intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, and the expression levels of Bcl-2, Bax, and caspase-3 protein in rat cardiomyocytes. In result, Mor, Dio, and M + D increased cell viability, inhibited cell apoptosis and decreased ROS levels. Additionally, the expression of Bax and Bcl-2 protein was modulated and the expression levels of caspase-3 protein were markedly decreased. Among the treatment groups, M + D produced the most prominent effects. In conclusion, our data showed for the first time that Mor, Dio, and M + D prevented high glucose (HG)-induced myocardial injury by reducing oxidative stress and apoptosis in rat cardiomyocytes. Among all the groups, M + D produced the strongest effect, while Mor and Dio produced weaker effects.\",\"full-text\":\"1. IntroductionDiabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), also known as diabetic heart disease, was originally put forward by Rubler in 1972 []. In recent years, DCM has imposed an increasing social and economic burden with an increase in the number of diabetics. Increasing evidence demonstrates that hyperglycemia induces apoptotic of cardiomyocytes, resulting in the development of DCM through different mechanisms [,], including oxidative stress and the Bax pathway. On the one hand, hyperglycemia may induce excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is regarded as the most important contributor in the occurrence and progression of DCM [], causing oxidative stress and eventually promoting cell apoptosis. Recent studies suggested that accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) under hyperglycemic conditions contributed to the development of diabetic complications. AGEs exert their effects directly or by binding their member receptor, receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), to activate the downstream signaling pathway []. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is an essential intracellular signaling pathway involved in cell growth, apoptosis, and a series of physiological and pathological processes []. Advanced glycation end products-Receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE-RAGE) interaction can induce pathophysiological cascades linked to the downstream activation of NF-\\u03baB, which in turn leads to ROS generation [], and enhance the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which can lead to the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes []. On the other hand, hyperglycemia also can lead to cell apoptosis through activation of Bax signaling pathway.\\n\\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been attracting more and more attention because of its prominent advantages, stable curative effects, and low toxicity in comparison to Western medicines [,]. Cornus officinalis Sieb.et Zucc, (Cornaceae), a deciduous tree native to the Eastern Asia, distributed mainly in China, as well as Korea and Japan, known as \\u201cShanzhuyu\\u201d in Chinese, often appeared in traditional Chinese medicine formulations, such as liu-wei-di-huang pills, for the treatment of diabetes []. It has also been reported that morroniside was a major active component of Cornus officinalis and had a markedly anti-diabetic effect via reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis []. Moreover, previous study from our lab has demonstrated that morroniside had a protective effect on high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis []. The content of morroniside from the iridoid glycoside fraction of Cornus officinalis (219.5 mg\\\/g) is the highest. So morroniside is regarded as main active components in Cornus officinalis []. Wang et al. research showed that the activity of SOD and the content of glutathione were significantly improved. Additionally, expression of caspase-3 in rat ischemic cortex tissue was decreased after treatment with morroniside []. Dioscorea opposita Thunb, (Dioscoreaceae), known as \\u201cShanyao\\u201d in Chinese, is classified as medicinal and edible plant in traditional Chinese medicine [] and also used as herb pairs of Cornus officinalis in the prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine dictionary for the treatment of diabetes []. Literature has reported that diosgenin was major a steroidal saponin in yam and the main metabolite of the steroidal saponins in vivo []. It had significantly protective effect on diabetes by attenuating the activities of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes []. In addition, diosgenin has potential effects on cardiovascular diseases and insulin secretion in STZ induced diabetic rats []. However, the protective effect of combination of morroniside and diosgenin on DCM has so far not been experimentally researched. Therefore, it aroused our interests to explore if the protective effect of combination of Mor and Dio played a crucial role on cardiomyocytes via the underlying mechanisms of multi-components on multi-targets during the development and progression of DCM.\\n\\nWe hypothesized that M + D exerted their myocardial protective effect on DCM through activation of the Bax signaling pathway. Furthermore, the advantage of M + D compared with Mor, Dio and the positive drugs (Met) would be discussed. To prove this hypothesis, we detected cell viability and apoptosis by MTT assay and TUNEL staining, ROS by using the fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate bis (DCFH-DA), Bcl-2\\\/Bax, and the expression levels of caspase-3 protein by Western blotting.\\n\\n2. Results2.1. Effects of (M + D)H on Cell ViabilityCell viability is shown in  using the MTT assay. At 72 h after high glucose injury in cardiomyocytes, in HG group, the proliferation of cardiomyocytes was markedly decreased compared with the CC group. However, in the MorH group (100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), the DioH group (100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), and the (M + D)H group (100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), the proliferation of cardiomyocytes was significantly increased compared to that in the HG group (p < 0.01). There was no obvious statistical difference between (M + D) group and Mor or Dio groups. The results of the MTT assay showed that MorH, DioH, and (M + D)H had an obviously protective effect on high glucose-induced cardiomyocytes injury. Then, MorH, DioH, and (M + D)H were, therefore, mainly used in subsequent experimental comparisons.\\n\\n2.2. Effects of (M + D)H on Cell ApoptosisApoptosis assay was measured with TUNEL staining. Cells with green nuclei were considered apoptotic, and our results revealed that few cells with nuclei stained green were observed in the (M + D)H group (). After being exposed to HG for 48 h, compared with the CC group, the total cell numbers were significantly reduced, and approximately 91.53% of cells showed apoptotic hallmarks. Compared with the HG group, (M + D)H significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells to 24.59% (p < 0.01, ), so that the total cell numbers were significantly increased. It was found that Mor, Dio, and M + D could reduce apoptosis of cells to varying degrees. Based on the comparison, (M + D)H was more effective than MorH and DioH in inhibiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes under hyperglycemic conditions.\\n\\n2.3. Effects of (M + D)H on Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)The molecular probe DCFH-DA was used to label peroxide in cardiomyocytes. After DCFH-DA, the results revealed that the ROS levels of the HG group were increased to 735.00 \\u00b1 12.82% as compared to the control level (263.75 \\u00b1 5.24%, p < 0.01), yet pretreatment of the cells with (M + D)H (342.51 \\u00b1 31.40%) markedly reduced the ROS levels compared with MorH (434.50 \\u00b1 10.14%), DioH (524.57 \\u00b1 5.73%), and Met (p < 0.01 ). There was no significant difference between Mor or Dio and HG group. Therefore, it was concluded that the cardioprotective effect of M + D was significant and enhanced its antioxidant effect.\\n\\n2.4. Effects of (M + D)H on the Expression Levels of Bax and Bcl-2 ProteinTo determine whether apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was involved in the Bax pathway, we tested expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 protein. As shown in , the Bcl-2\\\/Bax ratio was decreased significantly in the HG-treated group compared with untreated controls. In contrast, the Mor, Dio, and Met treatment increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax in cardiomyocytes to different degrees. In the (M + D)H-treated group, the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax was markedly increased compared to MorH, DioH, and Met (p < 0.01). Altogether, these data suggested that (M + D)H was the most effective in the aspect of anti-apoptosis via the Bax pathway.\\n\\n2.5. Effects of (M + D)H on the Expression Levels of Caspase-3 ProteinIt is known that HG-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is tightly regulated by caspase-3 []. Hence, we measured the expression levels of caspase-3 protein in cardiomyocytes by Western blot. As shown in B, HG treatment significantly increased the expression levels of caspase-3 protein. In contrast, cardiomyocytes that were pre-treated with Mor, Dio, M + D and Met exhibited a significant decrease in expression levels of caspase-3 protein compared with the HG-treated cells at the same time point. However, (M + D)H was the most effective compared to MorH, DioH, and Met (p < 0.01). These results indicated that the cardioprotective effect of M + D better inhibited the expression levels of caspase-3 protein through blocking a Bax pathway.\\n\\n2.6. Effects of (M + D)H on Caspase-3 ActivityTo further confirm whether M + D could inhibit caspase-3 activity, we examined caspase-3 activity by using a colorimetric activity assay kit. As illustrated in A, HG resulted in a prominent increase in caspase-3 activity compared to that in the CC group (p < 0.01), whereas the Mor, Dio, and Met reduced the level of caspase-3 activity to varying degrees compared with that of the HG group (p < 0.05). However, in the (M + D)H group, caspase-3 activity can \n\nRespond with a JSON array of objects in this format:

We\\nalso present evidence that several additional members of the OPFR\\nchemical class may also inhibit the same set of Ces enzymes that cause these dyslipidemic phenotypes.\\n\\nTo identify\\ndirect protein targets of TPP in vivo in mice, we\\ndeveloped two bioorthogonal chemoproteomic probes that\\nmimic the TPP structure, TPPyne1 and TPPyne2 (Figure A). These probes are TPP analogs that include a bioorthogonal\\nalkyne handle that can be reacted with an analytical tag, such as\\nrhodamine-azide or biotin-azide, by copper-catalyzed click chemistry, for subsequent fluorescent detection or mass-spectrometry-based\\nproteomic identification of probe targets, respectively (Figure B). We pretreated mice with vehicle or TPP (for\\n1 h) prior to administration of mice with the TPPyne probes (for 3\\nh). A rhodamine analytical handle was then appended to the TPPyne-bound\\nproteins in liver lysates ex vivo by click chemistry\\nto visualize probe-bound targets. Interestingly, we found that both\\nprobes labeled several TPP-specific protein targets in vivo in mouse livers, that is, proteins whose labeling by the TPPyne\\nprobes were competed out by TPP preadministration. TPPyne2 showed\\nmore TPP-specific and fewer probe-specific targets compared to TPPyne1,\\nthat is, TPPyne1 showed more nonspecific targets that were not competed\\nby TPP, compared to TPPyne2 (Figure C). Thus,\\nwe proceeded to use TPPyne2 for subsequent proteomic identification\\nof TPP-specific targets.\\n\\nTo identify the in vivo biological targets of\\nTPP, we appended a biotin analytical handle onto proteins labeled\\nby TPPyne2 in liver lysates from the TPPyne2-treated mice using click\\nchemistry, avidin-enriched the probe-labeled proteins, trypsinized\\nthe enriched proteome, and analyzed subsequent tryptic peptides by\\nMultidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT). We identified five protein targets from liver\\nlysates that were significantly enriched by the TPPyne2 probe (p < 0.05) compared with lysates from TPP pretreated TPPyne\\n2-treated mice (Figure D). We interpret these\\ntargets to be TPP-specific protein targets bound in vivo in mouse liver. All five protein targets were Ces enzymes, Ces1f, Ces1g, Ces2a, Ces1e, and Ces1c. Ces enzymes belong to the serine\\nhydrolase superfamily and have collectively been implicated as both\\nliver triacylglycerol hydrolases and detoxification enzymes for carboxylester\\nxenobiotics., In a separate experiment, we tested\\nwhether TPP inhibited the activity of these Ces enzymes,\\nrather than merely binding these proteins in an activity-independent\\nmanner, using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) coupled to MudPIT\\n(ABPP-MudPIT) with the serine hydrolase activity-based probe, fluorophosphonate-biotin\\n(FP-biotin), ( Figure S1, Figure S2). ABPP uses active-site directed\\nprobes to directly measure the activities of enzymes in complex biological\\nsamples.\\u2212 Previous studies have shown that the serine hydrolase activity-based\\nprobes FP-biotin and FP-rhodamine bind only to active, but not inactive\\nor inhibited, serine hydrolases and can be used to measure the activities\\nof many serine hydrolases, including Ces enzymes.\\u2212 Indeed, using ABPP-MudPIT, we show that Ces1f, Ces1g, Ces2a, Ces1e, and Ces1c activities\\nare inhibited by TPP in vivo.\\n\\nWe reason that\\nthis inhibition of Ces activity\\nis through irreversible phosphorylation of TPP to the Ces active-site serine, as has been shown for other OP compounds ( Figure S3)., As evidence of this irreversible binding, we show that TPPyne2-bound Ces targets are visible on a denaturing SDS\\\/PAGE gel and\\nare enriched and identified by proteomics under denaturing conditions\\n(Figure C, D). To experimentally determine\\nthe nature of this interaction, we generated a catalytically inactive Ces1g Serine 221 to Alanine (S221A) mutant enzyme. We demonstrate\\nthat TPPyne2 labels wild-type Ces1g, but not Ces1g S221A, providing evidence of a covalent interaction\\nat the active-site serine of the enzymes, much like other OP compounds\\nthat phosphorylate the active-site serine of serine hydrolases to\\ncause functional inhibition ( Figure S3). Thus, we propose that TPP likely binds irreversibly\\nto the active-site serine of Ces enzymes. Though\\nmany OP toxicants have been known to elicit their primary mode of\\ntoxicity through acetylcholineterase (AChE) inhibition, we demonstrate\\nthat TPP does not inhibit either acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or butyrylcholinesterase\\n(BChE) activity ( Figure S4).\\n\\nTotal carboxylesterase activity has also been\\npreviously assayed\\nby measuring p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis., TPP treatment in vivo in mice significantly inhibits\\ntotal liver p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolytic activity\\nby 43% ( Figure S5A).\\nTo further confirm that TPP inhibits the activities of the specific\\nTPP target Ces enzymes, we next tested whether TPP\\ninhibits p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolytic activity\\nin HEK293T lysates overexpressing the five Ces TPP\\ntargets. Despite ABPP data showing that all five Ces enzymes were overexpressed and active (), Ces1c and Ces1g did\\nnot significantly hydrolyze this substrate (). Only Ces1e, Ces1f,\\nand Ces2a were capable of hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl acetate.\n\nRespond with a JSON array of objects in this format:

Results from this screening identified Nrf2 activators, and provide novel insights into chemical scaffolds that might prevent oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionOxidative stress is the consequence of imbalanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cells to detoxify these ROS, which can result in ROS-induced tissue damage. In humans, oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous clinical conditions, including atherosclerosis , Alzheimer's disease , and rheumatoid arthritis . In addition, ROS, together with other electrophiles, are capable of attacking DNA in the nucleus increasing the risk of carcinogenesis .\\n\\nThe Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) - nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2 (Nrf2) pathway serves as one of the major protective mechanisms in cells in response to oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the cytoskeletal anchoring protein Keap1, and is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. Upon the stimuli of oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 and Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus . Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins, including members of the activator protein-1 family (Jun and Fos), and the small Maf family of transcription factors . These protein complexes bind to antioxidant response elements (ARE) located in the upstream promoter region of a battery of genes, and drives their transcription .\\n\\nThe Nrf2 target genes are involved in a variety of cytoprotective events, such as glutathione (GSH) synthesis and recycling (Gclc, Gclm, Gss, Gsr), reduction of hydrogen peroxide (Gpx), reduction of oxidized protein (Txn, Txnrd, Srxn), detoxification of electrophiles (Nqo1, Gst), and excretion of GSH-conjugated electrophiles (Mrp) . Thus, it is not surprising that Nrf2 deficient mice are more susceptible, whereas Nrf2 enhanced mice are resistant to chemical-induced oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress and subsequent tissue injury. For example, compared with wild-type mice, Nrf2-null mice are more susceptible to acetaminophen-induced liver injury , cigarette smoke-induced lung injury , dextran sulfate sodium\\\/azoxymethane-induced colitis and colorectal cancer , and benzo[a]pyrene-induced forestomach cancer . In contrast, Keap1-knockdown and Keap1-hepatoctye knockout mice, in which Nrf2 is constitutively activated, are highly resistant to acetaminophen , diquat , and cadmium -induced lethality and tissue injury. In addition, a number of synthetic and natural compounds protect against oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced toxicity, at least partially through activating Nrf2. For example, curcumin protects against focal ischemia of the cerebrum through upregulation of Nrf2 , and oltipraz protects against ANIT-induced cholestasis through Nrf2 activation .\\n\\nThese data suggest potential therapeutic applications of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, and thus Nrf2 is a promising drug target in the treatment of oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced diseases. A quantitative bioassay evaluating the induction of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), the prototypical Nrf2 target gene, in Hepa1c1c7 murine hepatoma cells was developed and still remains a major screening tool for potential activators of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway . To date, a number of compounds with diverse chemical structures have been shown to activate Keap1-Nrf2, including oxidizable diphenols (tBHQ), dithiolethiones (oltipraz), isothiocyanates (sulforaphane), and Michael acceptors (curcumin, cinnamates, and chalcones) . In an effort to develop more potent and effective activators of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, chemical derivatives of known active compounds were synthesized and screened. The most potent known Nrf2 activator, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-bien-28-oic acid imidazole (CDDO-Im), is a semisynthetic triterpenoids derived from oleanolic acid . Based on the structure-activity relationship analyses of the oleanolic triterpenoids, (\\u00b1)-(4bS,8aR,10aS)-10a-ethynyl-4b,8,8-trimethyl-3,7-dioxo-3,4b,7,8,8a,9,10,10a-octahydrophenanthrene-2,6-dicarbonitrile (TBE-31), was synthesized. Both CDDO-Im and TBE-31 activate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway at nano-molar concentrations in vitro and in vivo\\n.\\n\\nDespite the discovery of a few potent Nrf2 activators (CDDO compounds and TBE-31), there is limited information about the chemical scaffolds that can potentially activate Nrf2. Recently, AREc32 cells were engineered. AREc32 cells, which are derived from MCF7 human breast cancer cells, are stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct under the control of eight copies of rat Gsta2 AREs in the promoter region . The AREc32 cells provide a rapid and convenient quantification of Nrf2-ARE induction by chemicals, and makes large scale-screening of Nrf2 activators possible.\\n\\nThe aim of the present study was to develop a high-throughput assay to evaluate Nrf2 activation using the AREc32 cells, screen a library of 47,000 compounds, and to find compounds that are potent and effective activators of Nrf2. In addition, through structural activity relationship analyses, the present study also aimed to discover novel chemical scaffolds that are likely to activate the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Results from this screening identified strong Nrf2 activators, and provide novel insights into chemical scaffolds that might detoxify oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress and prevent oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsCell growth and maintenanceThe AREc32 cells were obtained from CRX biosciences (Dundee, Scotland, UK). The AREc32 are a stable cell line derived from the human MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line with a transfected luciferase gene construct that under the control of eight copies of rat Gsta2 AREs in the promoter region . AREc32 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the antibiotic G418 (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). The cells were grown at 37\\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2.\\n\\nAREc32 cells were seeded into 384-well plates (flat-bottom white, opaque, sterile, with lids) at a density of 3,500 cells\\\/well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in 50 \\u00b5L of complete media per well. Cell plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min following seeding to allow for even cell settling.

In order to study the mechanism of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in breast cancer, we generated and validated genomic profiles of drug response using a series of breast cancer cell lines sensitive to each drug. These genomic profiles were then used to model drug response in human breast tumors and show significant correlation between VPA and SAHA response profiles in multiple breast tumor data sets, highlighting their similar mechanism of action. The genes deregulated by VPA and SAHA converge on the cell cycle pathway (Bayes factor 5.21 and 5.94, respectively; P-value 10(-8.6) and 10(-9), respectively). In particular, VPA and SAHA upregulate key cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. In two independent datasets, cancer cells treated with CDK inhibitors have similar gene expression profile changes to the cellular response to HDAC inhibitors. Together, these results led us to hypothesize that VPA and SAHA may interact synergistically with CDK inhibitors such as PD-033299. Experiments show that HDAC and CDK inhibitors have statistically significant synergy in both breast cancer cell lines and primary 3-dimensional cultures of cells from pleural effusions of patients. Therefore, synergistic relationships between HDAC and CDK inhibitors may provide an effective combinatorial regimen for breast cancer. Importantly, these studies provide an example of how genomic analysis of drug-response profiles can be used to design rational drug combinations for cancer treatment.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionMost clinical trials apply single-agent and combinatorial regimens to unselected patients in a random manner, diluting the ability to find successful treatment approaches. This indiscriminate approach has failed to identify curative regimens for many breast cancer patients. In fact, approximately 17% of women with regional breast cancer and 74% of women with metastatic breast cancer will die from their disease within 5 years . Advances using therapies targeted at deregulated pathways have had some successes, but the ability to systematically assess the sensitivity of individual cancers to effective drugs remains to be refined. As with chemotherapy, it is highly likely that combinations of targeted therapies will be critical for effective treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, as more and more potent single-agent inhibitors are developed, the question becomes how to find useful combinations without resorting to large mechanism-blind clinical trials.\\n\\nOne class of drugs that we do not know appropriate combination regimens for is the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Epigenetic modifications affect a wide range of biological processes and play key roles in development and tumorigenesis , . Among the key chromatin modifying enzymes that affect epigenetic states and gene transcription are the histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs have been shown to impact tumor development and progression \\u2013. Overexpression of HDACs have been found in several cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer \\u2013. Drugs that target HDACs have been used in clinical trials for multiple types of solid tumors with some success , . We used gene expression profiling to explore the mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors in order to rationally combine appropriate therapies.\\n\\nThe effects of HDAC inhibitors include induction of differentiation, arrest in cell cycle in G1 and\\\/or G2, and induction of apoptosis , . Cell cycle arrest at G1\\\/S boundary can be associated with the induction of members of the CIP\\\/KIP family of CDKs inhibitors, such as CDKN1A (p21, WAF\\\/CIP1) and CDKN1C (p57, KIP2). Induction of CDK inhibitors results in p53-independent hypophosphorylation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene product, the phosphorylation of which is required for the progression from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle , . In vitro experiments with cell lines have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors can increase CDK inhibitor expression, including CDKN1C\\u2013. In breast cancer, tumors do not typically express CDKN1C due to promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation \\u2013. Importantly, low expression of CDKN1C is associated with poor clinical outcome, and the reintroduction of CDKN1C expression in vitro results in suppression of cell transformation, suggesting that CDKN1C may act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, .\\n\\nOur overarching goal is to use genomics to rationally identify optimal combination regimens for cancer. In principle, two drugs that produce similar effects can be synergistic when used concurrently. We generate gene expression profiles of drug response to VPA and SAHA, two HDAC inhibitors. In order to capture the diversity of breast cancer, we developed profiles using panels of breast cancer cell lines of various phenotypes that are sensitive to each specific drug profiled. Examination of gene expression changes in response to HDAC inhibitors highlight the critical role of cell cycle regulated genes. These results led to the hypothesis that CDK inhibitors would synergize with HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer. We demonstrate synergy between HDAC inhibitors and CDK inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines and primary patient tumors grown in 3-dimensional culture. Together, these results highlight a novel therapeutic combination rationally designed by genomic analysis.\\n\\nMethodsCell cultures and drugsBreast cancer cell lines HCC1143, HCC38, HCC1806, BT483, BT549, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-453, SKBR3, and T47D were maintained in culture in RPMI (SIGMA) containing 2 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen), 4.5 g\\\/L glucose (Invitrogen), and 10 % fetal bovine serum (Sigma).

Valproic Acid (VPA) (SIGMA) was dissolved in water at stock concentration of 500 mM; suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (Cayman Chemical) was resuspended in DMSO at stock concentration of 20 mM; PD-0332991 (Selleck) was dissolved in DMSO at stock concentration of 10 mM.\\n\\nGeneration of drug response profiles for HDAC inhibitorsBreast cancer cell lines sensitive to HDAC inhibitors as determined by their EC50 (HCC38, BT483, BT549, BT474, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-453, SKBR3, ZR75, CAMAI, MCF7, Hs578t, T47D) representing the major breast cancer phenotypes (ER\\u2212\\\/PR\\u2212\\\/ErbB2\\u2212; ER+\\\/ PR+\\\/ ErbB2 +; ER\\u2212\\\/PR\\u2212\\\/ ErbB2+) were seeded in 100 mm plates (NUNC) in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum, at 75% density. After 24 h, VPA or SAHA were added at the final concentration of 5 mM VPA and 1.5 \\u03bcM SAHA. After 6 h the cells were harvested and subjected to RNA purification by RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and 1 \\u03bcg of each sample was later hybridized to Affymetrix U133 microarrays according to the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol. To verify VPA and SAHA efficacy on HDACs activity, a portion of each sample was subjected to histone purification (Active Motif) and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were hybridized with anti-acetyl-histone H4 (Millipore) antibody to evaluate the histone acetylation status, and the proteins visualized with the ECL Plus Western Blot Detection system (GE Healthcare) (data not shown).\\n\\nMicroarray data were analyzed as described in the . In brief, microarray data were MAS 5.0 normalized, scaled by log base 2, and then quantile normalized. Distance weighted discrimination was used to eliminate differences between the training cell lines and datasets. A Bayesian analysis binary regression model was then used to derive the profiles..

After 24h, 5 mM VPA or 1.5 uM SAHA were added to the media. After 24 and 48h the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) containing 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride(PMSF), and 100\\u03bcM protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma). After centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4\\u00b0C, the protein yield was quantified by Bradford assay (Pierce), and equivalent amounts of protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total CDKN1C and CDKN1A expression was detected by primary antibody to CDKN1C (Cell Signaling), and mouse p21(Amersham).. GAPDH (AbCam) was used as loading control. Western blots were developed with the ECL Plus Western Blot Detection system.\\n\\nStatistical analysisGene Ontology calculations were done using http:\\\/\\\/gather.genome.duke.edu and werw limited to genes significantly deregulated following drug treatment (p value<=0.001 by paired t-test). Bayes factors (the ratio of the posterior probability of associating a particular Gene Ontology category and the given gene list to the probability in a random gene list) and p-values were calculated. In all figures, error bars represent 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise noted. Bliss Interaction Index for dose d1 of drug A and dose d2of drug B was calculated as: \\nI=fd1,A+d2,Bfd1,A+fd2,B-fd1,A\\u00d7fd2,B where fd1,A is the percent inhibition in cell number when treated with drug A at dose d1 and fd2,B is the percent inhibition in cell number when treated with drug B at dose d2. Two drugs are synergistic if the Bliss Interaction Index is greater than 1 and antagonistic if it is less than 1. Each combination was tested in triplicate for 2-D cultures and duplicate for 3-D cultures, and variability of Bliss Interaction Index was confirmed by 2-way ANOVA. For those cell lines with 2-way ANOVA p-values < 0.05, Bonferroni post-testing was performed to compare each dose combina\n\nRespond with a JSON array of objects in this format:

The trends in the incidence of such diseases have developed in a timeframe inconsistent with the much slower pace of changes in the human genome, suggesting that environmental factors have shaped these disease patterns. Reports by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Environment Program, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Endocrine Society, indicated that early-life chemical exposure can cause serious adverse effects during susceptible periods of human development that endure into later life. Identification of the environmental chemicals that may induce adverse pregnancy outcomes and adult metabolic diseases is essential.\\n\\nEpidemiological studies have linked environmental chemicals such as bisphenol A, phthalates, perfluoroalkyl acids, and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) to adverse pregnancy outcomes and adult metabolic diseases. Because human population studies were complicated by the diverse genetic backgrounds of the subjects and their concurrent exposure to numerous chemicals, these studies often yielded heterogeneous results and may not provide direct evidences of causal relationships. As a crucial organ in the regulation of fetal development, the placenta is responsible for secretion of hormones that reprogram maternal physiology and for maternal\\u2013fetal material exchange. Cumulative evidence suggested that placental disorders can induce adverse pregnancy outcomes and, by the \\u201cthrifty phenotype hypothesis,\\u201d permanently alter human metabolism and increase the risk of lifelong metabolic diseases., Placenta develops from trophoblasts to mature placenta during the first trimster of human pregnancy. Placentation is particularly essential because it models the basic pattern of materal\\u2013fetal interaction and gradually promotes maternal adaptation to invasive tissue. However, whether and how a xenobiotic affects human placentation remains unknown, owing to limited access to developing human placenta tissues and absence of practical experimental models.\\n\\nBecause adverse effects assessed using cell lines lack relevance for human health, directly modeling complex human disease and tissue biology using high-throughput assays is desirable, as proposed in the ToxCast program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency., Recently developed human trophoblast organoids displayed near-physiological cellular composition and behavior relative to immature human placenta and allowed dynamic placentation to be observed. Establishing a high-throughput screening model using human trophoblast organoids may be desirable in identifying a chemical that may disrupt human placentation from a wide range of chemicals.\\n\\nHere, we devised a high-throughput immunofluorescence screening assay based on human trophoblast organoids and used it to screen for OPFRs that could inhibit proliferation. OPFRs as substitutes for conventional flame retardants are commonly used in furniture and electronic productions and have been detected in humans worldwide., We used short-term and long-term exposure strategies to investigate the effects of one such chemical, 2-ethylhexyl-diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), on placentation in trophoblast organoids and the associated molecular mechanisms because EHDPP has been widely detected in both the environment and the human body. Finally, the possible occurrence of disorders in immature and mature placentas and adverse pregnancy outcomes were investigated in mice.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe performed model validation, high-throughput screening, and short- and long-term exposure studies and explored the associated mechanisms in organoids. Animal studies were also performed. The experiments and their aims are summarized in .\\n\\nFigure 1.Summary of methods.

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is an essential growth factor that is involved in tissue repair and pulmonary fibrogenesis. In the present study, the role of CTGF was examined in a rat model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by PQ poisoning. Histological examination revealed interstitial edema and extensive cellular thickening of interalveolar septa at the early stages of poisoning. At 2 weeks after PQ administration, lung tissue sections exhibited a marked thickening of the alveolar walls with an accumulation of interstitial cells with a fibroblastic appearance. Masson's trichrome staining revealed a patchy distribution of collagen deposition, indicating pulmonary fibrogenesis. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining of tissue samples demonstrated that CTGF expression was significantly upregulated in the PQ-treated group. Similarly, PQ treatment of MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells caused an increase in CTGF in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the addition of CTGF to MRC-5 cells triggered cellular proliferation and migration. In addition, CTGF induced the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, as was evident from increased expression of \\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\\u03b1-SMA) and collagen. These findings demonstrate that PQ causes increased CTGF expression, which triggers proliferation, migration and differentiation of lung fibroblasts. Therefore, CTGF may be important in PQ-induced pulmonary fibrogenesis, rendering this growth factor a potential pharmacological target for reducing lung injury.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionParaquat dichloride (1,1\\u2032-dimethyl-4,4\\u2032-bipyridinium dichloride; methyl viologen; PQ) is an effective and widely used herbicide that can cause pulmonary fibrosis (,). Previous studies have demonstrated that the lungs are one of the primary target organs for PQ-induced toxicity in humans and animals (,). The acute toxic effects of PQ, including pulmonary edema and hypoxia, lead to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Notably, 1,000s of mortalities due to intentional or accidental ingestion of PQ have been reported (,). Although certain drugs, including glucocorticoids, antioxidants and cytotoxic drugs, can mitigate toxicity (\\u2013), the treatment of acute PQ poisoning is often poor and mortality rates remain high (,). Since an effective PQ antidote has yet to be identified, studies on the molecular mechanisms of PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis are critical for improving treatment and reducing mortality.\\n\\nConnective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich extracellular matrix-associated heparin-binding protein that belongs to the CCN family (,). CTGF is widely expressed in numerous tissues at low levels, however, is markedly upregulated in fibrotic and cancerous tissue (). CTGF regulates various biological processes associated with fibro-genesis, including cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, extracellular matrix (ECM) production (\\u2013) and angiogenesis (). In particular, CTGF has been found to promote deposition of several ECM proteins, including collagen, fibronectin and tenascin C (,). Aberrant ECM production by lung fibroblasts has been associated with fibrosis in several models of pulmonary injury (,). ECM production could further be stimulated as a consequence of lung fibroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation into myofibroblasts (). Accordingly, CTGF has been demonstrated to affect various cell types involved in the fibrogenic process, including type II alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells and lung fibroblasts ().\\n\\nAlthough CTGF has been demonstrated to be important in pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin and hyperoxia (,), an association between this growth factor and PQ-induced lung injury has not been established. In particular, the effect of CTGF on ECM production, cellular proliferation, migration and myofibroblast differentiation in association with PQ poisoning remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of PQ on CTGF expression and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsEthics statementAll animals were handled in accordance with guidelines approved by the Experimentation Ethics Review Committee of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). The rats were fed with commercial rat chow, provided with water ad libitum and kept on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle.\\n\\nCell cultureMRC-5 lung fibroblasts (human lung fibroblasts; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA; cat. no. CCL 171) were cultured in high Dulbecco\\u2019s modified Eagle\\u2019s medium (DMEM; HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin\\\/streptomycin solution. Cells were incubated at 37\\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and routinely passaged upon reaching 80% confluency, using 0.25% trypsin and a 1:3 cell dilution for each passage.\\n\\nCell viabilityThe viability of lung fibroblasts was evaluated using a Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) assay. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2\\u00d7106 cells\\\/ml for 12 h and treated with various concentrations of CTGF (50\\u2013200 ng\\\/ml; PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) for 24, 48 or 72 h. The cells were then transferred into a 96-well culture plate (n=8) at a density of 2\\u00d7104 cells\\\/100 \\u03bcl\\\/well for 12 h. The culture medium was removed and 100 \\u03bcl of serum-free medium containing 10 \\u03bcl of CCK-8 solution was added to each well. After a 4 h incubation period, the absorbance was measured at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm using a multi-detection microplate reader (VersaMax; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\\n\\nCell migrationA double-chamber system was used to perform a transwell migration assay to determine the migration ability of lung fibroblasts. Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate with serum-free medium at a density of 4\\u00d7104 cells\\\/per upper chamber. Culture medium (1 ml) with 10% FBS containing various concentrations of CTGF (50\\u2013200 ng\\\/ml) was simultaneously added to the lower chamber. The upper and lower chambers were separated by a permeable polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 8 \\u03bcm. The cells were permitted to migrate to the lower chamber for 24 h. Following this incubation period, cells that had entered the lower surface of the filter membrane were fixed with a cold solution of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. Cells that remained in the upper surface were gently scraped off with a cotton swab. A total of 10 different fields of view from each membrane were randomly selected and captured using a photomicroscope (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell migration was quantified by counting the number of migrated cells. Experiments were performed three times in duplicate.\\n\\nAnimal groups and experimental protocolA total of 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200\\u2013250 g were purchased from the Animal Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). The SD rats were randomly divided into two groups (n=24 for each group). The experimental group received a single intraperitoneal injection of PQ (30 mg\\\/kg), while the control group received an equivalent volume of sterile saline. The rats were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation after 7, 14 and 28 days.\\n\\nHistological analysisFollowing sacrificing the animals, the lungs were removed and the left lung was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h. The tissue samples were then processed using graded alcohol, xylene and paraffin and blocked in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded sections (5 \\u03bcm thick) were stained using a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) kit (Biyuntian, Inc., Nantong, China) and a Masson\\u2019s trichrome staining kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. The slides with H&E staining were examined using light microscopy (Eclipse TE2000-S; Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and images were captured to determine the integrity of the tissue. The severity of pulmonary fibrosis in the lung sections stained for collagen with Masson\\u2019s trichrome stain was determined by a histopathologist who was blinded to the protocol design.\\n\\nImmunohistochemical stainingFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin sections were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-CTGF antibodies (cat. no. ab6992; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). Following transferal through a graded series of alcohol and xylene, lung tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 \\u03bcm). The sample sections were mounted onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides and processed for immunohistochemical analysis, according to a similar procedure as previously reported (). Briefly, sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at 37\\u00b0C for blockade of non-specific binding sites and then incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C with the primary antibody targeting CTGF (1:200 dilution). Specificity of the antibody was examined using normal rabbit serum instead of the primary antibody. The slides were then incubated with a secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 dilution; cat. no. BA1003; Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Ltd., Wuhan, China) for 30 min at 37\\u00b0C. Following rinsing, the slides were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and then washed with deionized water. The samples were then exposed to 3,3\\u2032-diaminobenzidine substrate solution for 10 min, coun-terstained with hematoxylin and mounted with coverslips. Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope (Nikon Corporation). A brown reaction product was considered a positive result.\\n\\nImmunofluorescenceTo evaluate the effect of CTGF on myofibroblast differentiation of human lung fibroblasts, MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were treated with 100 ng\\\/ml CTGF (PeproTech, Inc.) for 3 days. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described (). Briefly, MRC-5 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-10\n\nRespond with a JSON array of objects in this format: [{\"ChemicalName\":\"Estradiol\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"IGF1\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Bos taurus\",\"Interaction\":\"Valproic Acid inhibits the reaction [IGF1 protein results in increased abundance of Estradiol]\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^reaction|increases^abundance\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Estradiol\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"IGF1\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Bos taurus\",\"Interaction\":\"IGF1 protein results in increased abundance of Estradiol\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance\"}]"}]},"expected":{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"Paraquat\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"CCN2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"Paraquat results in increased expression of CCN2 protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Paraquat\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"CCN2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"Paraquat results in increased expression of CCN2 protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"}]"},"completion":{"id":"chatcmpl-81M9z2Iu4pEbFZ41bslTqj64y4WV7","object":"chat.completion","created":1695334203,"model":"ft:gpt-3.5-turbo-0613:https-insilica-co::81I7Vkeg","choices":[{"index":0,"message":{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"SERPINE1\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor results in increased secretion of SERPINE1 protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^secretion\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"ACTA2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor results in increased expression of ACTA2 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"COL1A2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"CTGF protein results in increased expression of COL1A2 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"ACTA2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor results in increased expression of ACTA2 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Connective Tissue Growth Factor\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"COL1A2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"CTG..."},"finish_reason":"stop"}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":2638,"completion_tokens":272,"total_tokens":2910}}}

Higher rates of TLR4 (53%), MD-2 (70%), and CXCR7 (29%) expression were found in colorectal carcinoma tissues than in normal tissues.

Death of these patients results from uncontrolled metastatic disease, including liver, lymph nodes, or peritoneum metastases. Inflammation is considered a risk factor for many common malignancies including cancers of the lung , breast , and colorectum . Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as chronic ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is associated with increased incidence of colorectal carcinoma as compared with the normal population \\u2013. The link between inflammation and colorectal carcinoma offers the possibility of identifying novel ways to prevent cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer remain elusive.\\n\\nDifferent products of enterobacteriaceae and especially their lipopolysaccharides (LPS) may also contribute to perpetuation of the chronic colorectal inflammation . Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is responsible for recognizing Gram-negative bacterial LPS, is upregulated and overexpressed in patients with IBD or colorectal carcinoma \\u2013 whereas TLR4 normally is expressed at low level in the intestinal mucosa , , . TLR4 is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as celiac disease  and IBD . Additionally, TLR4 elicits appropriate immune activation in various types of cancer such as lung, ovary, stomach and colorectum. LPS binding induces the formation of a symmetric M-shaped TLR4-MD-2-LPS multimer composed of two copies of the complex to activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, which could induce expression of some chemoattractant receptors \\u2013. Nevertheless, little else is known of the involvement of TLR4 in the progression of colorectal carcinoma.\\n\\nInitiation and progression of malignancies is the result of a series of complex processes that depend upon multiple and interactive factors . Clinical and experimental studies indicate that CXC chemokines enhance immunity to tumor-associated antigens. However, they may also promote angiogenesis, proliferation and tumor cell invasion, such as the CXCL12 (SDF-1)\\\/CXCR4 axis . Recently, CXCR7 was identified as a second receptor for CXCL12. It was described to be present on the surface of many tumor cell types and on activated endothelial cells. Generally, but depending on cell type, CXCR7 was reported to be either a non-signaling receptor (decoy receptor) or a signaling receptor. However, the function and regulatory mechanisms of CXCR4\\\/CXCR7 and the relationship between TLR4-MD-2 and CXCR4\\\/CXCR7 in colorectal carcinoma is still unknown.\\n\\nOur studies suggest that exposure to LPS elevates CXCR7 expression in a colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines expressing TLR4\\\/MD-2. Meanwhile, CXCR7\\\/CXCL12 modulates tumor cell proliferation and migration. However, exposure of SW480 and Colo 205 cells to LPS had no effect on CXCR4 expression. Exposure of HT-29 cells with expression of only TLR4 to LPS had no effect on CXCR7 or CXCR4 expression. Furthermore, we found that combined expression of all three markers (TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7) more strongly correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis than did each of the three markers alone. Thus, recombination of TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 may prove to be valuable prognostic markers for predicting the proliferation and metastatic ability of colorectal carcinoma cells. An understanding of the relationships between microbial signals and colorectal carcinoma tissue might provide further clues for the development of new therapeutic strategies.\\n\\nResultsExposure of TLR4 to LPS elevates CXCR7 expression in colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell linesmRNA of colorectal carcinoma cell lines encoding TLR4 with its co-molecules, MD-2 were determined using RT-PCR. The analysis of RT-PCR products showed that TLR4 and MD-2 were constitutively expressed in 4 out of 8 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, including Colo 205, RKO, SW480 and SW620, whereas TLR4 and MD-2 were present respectively in only two cell lines such as DLD-1 and HCT-29 (). We tested two cell lines(SW480 and Colo 205) with expression of both TLR4 and MD-2 and one(HT-29) with expression of only TLR4.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0027399.g001Figure 1LPS-TLR4-MD-2 induced CXCR7 expression alteration in colorectal carcinoma cell line.A, Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis (TLR4 and MD-2) on RNA isolated from 8 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines.

Real-time quantitative-PCR and flow cytometry clearly indicated that the exposure of SW480 cells expressing TLR4\\\/MD-2 to LPS induced CXCR7 expression alterations significantly (p<0.001, p<0.001, resp.; ). CXCR7 and CXCR4 were not expressed on Colo 205 cells.

BEAS-2B cells were transfected with silencing RNA (siRNA) specific to Nrf2 and exposed to DEP. The relative levels of mRNA for Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1, LC3B, p62 and Atg5 were determined using RT-PCR, while the levels of LCB3, Nrf2, and p62 protein were determined using Western blotting.

Air pollution particulate matter (PM) induces oxidative stress in airway tissues, causing living organisms to activate their defences to prevent cell death\\u2013. One mechanism that cells use for defence against oxidative stress is autophagy, which is a homeostatic process that reduces cytoplasmic volume by degrading damaged organelles and proteins through a lysosome-dependent degradation process, and new organelles and proteins are synthesized as replacements\\u2013. Previous studies have emphasized that exposure to PM induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases the levels of autophagy and cell death\\u2013.\\n\\nSome of the most harmful components of urban PM are derived from diesel exhaust particles (DEP),. Usually, composed of carbon nuclei, DEP have large surface areas that can adsorb other chemicals in the environment, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), sulphate, nitrate, metals, carbon monoxide, aldehydes and various low molecular weight hydrocarbons,. PAHs and their derivatives are especially important because they are able to generate ROS in tissues.\\n\\nGenes encoding key antioxidant enzymes are important for maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis through the antioxidant response element (ARE) found within the promoter regions of these genes. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2, also known as Nrf2) induces ARE genes as part of a protective response against oxidative challenge to organelles and macromolecules.\\n\\nRecent in vivo and in vitro models have shown that the oxidative damage caused by PM exposure can activate the Nrf2-antioxidant response element signalling pathway,. Additionally, A549 cell and murine alveolar macrophage cultures exposed to DEP have shown increased Nrf2 and HO-1 (an Nrf2 target gene) expression levels.\\n\\nThere is evidence that some autophagy genes, such as Atg5, Atg4D and SQSTM1\\\/p62, have ARE promoter regions, and these promotors may be regulated through Nrf2 activity. Nrf2 is normally present in the cytoplasm attached to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which facilitates the ubiquitination and proteolysis of Nrf2. In addition, protein p62 interacts with the same binding site as that of Nrf2-Keap1 and competitively inhibits the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction. The accumulation of p62 within the cells allows it to interact with Keap1 more frequently, resulting in the inhibition of Keap1 and, consequently, the activation of Nrf2,. Also, p62 has been found to be a mediator in the formation of protein aggregates for autophagy recycling, functioning as an adapter for facilitating the binding of ubiquitinated protein aggregates and delivering them to autophagosomes, by associating with LC3 (protein light chain 3) a protein in autophagosome membrane\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to examine the role of DEP in the Nrf2\\\/ARE-mediated oxidant response and the influence of this pathway on the induction of autophagy in the human BEAS-2B bronchial cell line.\\n\\nResultsDEP characterizationTo verify the composition of the DEP collected, two characterization assays were performed: EDX (X-ray fluorescence by the energy dispersive method) to determine elements that comprise the DEP (Table\\u00a0); high-performance liquid chromatography to separate the PAH fractions and their derivatives; and gas chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry (GC\\\/MS) was chosen for identification and quantification (Table\\u00a0).

The consequent shortage of mevalonate-derived isoprenoid compounds results in an inflammatory phenotype, caused by the activation of the NALP3 inflammasome that determines an increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1 \\u03b2 release. In MKD, febrile temperature can further decrease the residual MK activity, leading to mevalonate pathway modulation and to possible disease worsening. We previously demonstrated that the administration of exogenous isoprenoids such as geraniol or the modulation of the enzymatic pathway with drugs, such as Tipifarnib, partially rescues the inflammatory phenotype associated with the defective mevalonic pathway. However, it has not been investigated yet how temperature can affect the success of these treatments. Thus, we investigated the effect of temperature on primary human monocytes from MKD patients. Furthermore the ability of geraniol and Tipifarnib to reduce the abnormal inflammatory response, already described at physiological temperature in MKD, was studied in a febrile condition. We evidenced the role of temperature in the modulation of the inflammatory events and suggested strongly considering this variable in future researches aimed at finding a treatment for MKD.\",\"full-text\":\"1. IntroductionMevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD), a rare autoinflammatory disease (OMIM no. 251170), is caused by mutations in the second enzyme of the mevalonate pathway (mevalonate kinase (MK)) resulting in reduced enzymatic activity and in the consequent shortage of downstream compounds [].\\n\\nMKD has an early onset usually in infancy and affects both sexes equally. A delay in molecular diagnosis frequently occurs, and systemic reactive AA amyloidosis, a form of amyloidosis, may be a severe long-term complication of this condition [\\u2013]. Different degrees of MKD severity were observed depending on MK residual activity, ranging from an autoinflammatory phenotype characterized by recurrent inflammatory episodes (Hyper-IgD Syndrome (HIDS), OMIM no. 260920) to a more severe clinical presentation, including neurological and psychomotor impairment (mevalonic aciduria (MA), OMIM no. 610377).\\n\\nThe lack of the mevalonate intermediate compound geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, resulting in the increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1\\u03b2 release, has been recently reported as the main pathogenic mechanism in MKD [, ].\\n\\nMultiprotein complexes called inflammasomes are capable of activating caspase-1, in response to many types of stimuli, including microbial and danger\\\/stress []. In particular, NALP3 inflammasome seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of MKD: inflammasome activation causes the increased secretion of IL-1\\u03b2 [] and the pyroptosis or caspase-1 dependent cell death [].\\n\\nThe main phenotypic characteristic of MKD patients is periodic fever. Temperature, indeed, plays a role in MKD, as elevated temperature (40\\u00b0C) can reduce even more the enzymatic activity of mutated MK, increasing the inflammatory response. However, an increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity will occur afterwards and compensate for the defect, allowing the resolution of the fever attack. These observations permitted to hypothesize that an increase in temperature may be involved in triggering the attacks [].\\n\\nAlthough in the last decade the knowledge of MKD pathogenesis has increased, an etiologic treatment for MKD is still unavailable, and anti-inflammatory drugs [] as well as novel biologic treatments [, ] are currently used with different and debatable results.\\n\\nWe recently showed that plant isoprenoids (such as geraniol) [] and inhibitors of farnesylation (such as Tipifarnib) [] could reverse the inflammatory response in cellular and animal MKD models [].\\n\\nExogenous isoprenoids are able to enter the mevalonate pathway, to be metabolized by the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme of the mevalonate pathway downstream MK, and to rescue the shortage of intermediate isoprenoids in MKD, models []. On the other hand, farnesylation inhibitors can reduce the consumption of farnesyl pyrophosphate, augmenting the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate available for the geranylgeranylation pathway [, ] ().\\n\\nWe previously suggested that plant isoprenoids [] and inhibitors of farnesylation [] could represent a potential specific pharmacologic approach for MKD; however we did not yet consider how the temperature could act on the anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds in MKD.\\n\\nTo investigate the hypothesis that temperature could affect anti-inflammatory effects, geraniol and Tipifarnib were evaluated in primary human monocytes obtained from MKD patients at different temperatures (37\\u00b0C and 40\\u00b0C).\\n\\n2.

SubjectsThe study was approved by the technical and scientific review board of the Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS \\u201cBurlo Garofolo,\\u201d Trieste (no. 185\\\/08, 19\\\/08\\\/2008). For a child to be eligible, informed consent had to be obtained from parents or caregivers. Furthermore, MKD patients of any age were excluded from the study if they had an acute or chronic infectious disease, any clinically significant disorder, and if they were on any medication with known influence on immunological factors (e.g., corticosteroids).\\n\\nBlood was collected by venipuncture from 3 MKD patients aged between 9 and 12 years (). MKD patients had no concurrent infection and were not in the acute phase of the disease. Patients' histories of previous infectious diseases and allergy were documented but not evaluated as covariates in the study, because it may affect the results.\\n\\n2.3. Monocyte Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood MonocytesMonocytes were isolated from MKD patients. Cells were cultured at 2 \\u00d7 105 cells\\\/well in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 1\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL LPS for 24\\u2009h in presence or not of 100\\u2009\\u03bcM GOH or 5\\u2009\\u03bcM Typ. The same experimental design was performed at 37\\u00b0C (physiological condition) and at 40\\u00b0C (acute inflammation condition). At the end of the incubation period the cell culture supernatants were collected for cytokine and inflammasome evaluation while the cells were pelleted for the programmed cell death (PCD) assays.\\n\\n2.4. Programmed Cell Death (PCD) AssaysThe PCD of human monocyte was analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V (A) and Propidium Iodide (PI) stainings. Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and Propidium Iodide (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit, Immunostep, Spain) following the manufacturer's indications. In brief, cells were harvested from the culture flasks and washed with PBS. 5 \\u00d7 105 cells were resuspended in manufacturer buffer and stained with A and PI for 15 minutes. Fluorescence was acquired with a FACScan Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) and a CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) and subsequently analyzed with a FlowJo software (version 7.6, Treestar, Inc., OR, USA). Debris as excluded from the plot based on the scatter; then apoptotic and necrotic cells were characterized based on the fluorescence emitted.\\n\\n2.5. Determination of NALP3 (NLRP3) ConcentrationHuman NLRP3 concentration was determined in the cell culture medium by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits according to manufacturer's protocols, and the amount of NLRP3 was expressed as ng\\\/mL (Human NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 ELISA Kit; Cusabio Biotech Co., ltd. Carlsbad, CA, USA).\\n\\n2.6. Determination of Cytokines ReleaseThe analysis of a 48 cytokines and chemokines panel (including IL-1\\u03b2, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, FGF basic, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-\\u03b3, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\\u03b1, PDGF-BB, MIP-1\\u03b2, RANTES, TNF-\\u03b2, VEGF, IL-1\\u03b1, IL-2R\\u03b1, IL-3, IL-12(p40), IL-16, IL-18, CTACK, GRO-\\u03b1, HGF, IFN-\\u03b12, LIF, MCP-3, M-CSF, MIF, MIG, \\u03b2-NGF, SCF, SCGF-\\u03b2, SDF-1\\u03b1, TNF-\\u03b1, and TRAIL) was performed on supernatant samples using a magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays (Bio-Plex) (BIO-RAD Laboratories, Milano, Italy) following manufacturer's instructions. Data from the reactions were acquired using the Bio-Plex 200 reader, while a digital processor managed data output and the Bio-Plex Manager software returned data as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and concentration (pg\\\/mL).\\n\\n2.7. Data AnalysisFor each set of experiments, values were analyzed by calculating means \\u00b1 standard error (SEM). The nonparametric one-way ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparison test as used when appropriate. Probability (P) values were calculated on the basis of one-tailed test. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant, unless established by the correction for multiple comparisons.\\n\\n3.

Molecular targeted therapies have not been widely used for stem cell leukemia\\\/lymphoma (SCLL). Ponatinib (AP24534), which potently inhibits native and mutant BCR-ABL, also targets the FGFR family. Using murine BaF3 cells, stably transformed with six different FGFR1 fusion genes, as well as human KG1 cells expressing activated chimeric FGFR1 and five newly established murine SCLL cell lines, we show that ponatinib (<50 nM) can effectively inhibit phosphoactivation of the fusion kinases and their downstream effectors, such as PLC\\u03b3, Stat5 and Src. Ponatinib also significantly extended survival of mice transplanted with different SCLL cell lines. Ponatinib administered at 30 mg\\\/kg daily also significantly delayed, or even prevented, tumorigenesis of KG1 cells in xenotransplanted mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ponatinib specifically inhibits cell growth and clonogenicity of normal human CD34+ progenitor cells transformed by chimeric FGFR1 fusion kinases. Overall, our data provide convincing evidence to suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR1 fusion kinases with ponatinib is likely to be beneficial for patients with SCLL and perhaps for other human disorders associated with dysregulated FGFR1 activity.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionStem cell leukemia\\\/lymphoma (SCLL), also known as the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS), has now been designated \\u2018myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with FGFR1 abnormalities (MLNAF)\\u2019 in the recent WHO classification. MLNAF is characterized by reciprocal chromosome translocations that fuse the FGFR1 kinase domain to a variety of fusion partner genes. These partners provide dimerization domains that facilitate constitutive and ligand-independent activation of the FGFR1 kinase, which leads to a variety of downstream signaling effects involving classical FGFR1 targets such as PLC\\u03b3, members of the Stat family of transcription factors\\u2013 and Src. Currently eleven FGFR1-associated fusion partners have been described, and the most common rearrangement in MLNAF involves a t(8;13)(p11;q11) translocation which fuses ZMYM2 (previously known as ZNF198) with FGFR1 (see review by). We have developed a transduction\\\/transplantation animal model for ZMYM2-FGFR1 which develops myeloproliferative disorder and T-cell lymphoma. The T-cell lymphomas are CD4+\\\/CD8+, have lost T-cell receptor alpha (Tcra) function and show upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl2 and Il2r. In addition, activated mutation of Notch1 was observed in all T-cell lymphomas induced by ZMYM2-FGFR. These observations could explain why the majority of ZMYM2-FGFR1 MLNAF patients develop T-lymphomas, .\\n\\nMLNAF is an aggressive disease, usually presenting with lymphoblastic lymphoma in association with a myeloproliferative disorder, accompanied with\\\/without peripheral eosinophilia. The disorder generally progresses to overt acute myelogenous leukemia within a year of diagnosis\\u2013. The overall mortality rate for MLNAF is >80%, which is significantly higher than in other myeloproliferative disorders, due largely to its aggressive nature and resistance to the current chemotherapy regimens used, which are mostly modified from regimens used for other leukemias\\\/lymphomas. Even allogenic bone marrow transplantation has only a limited associated survival. The molecular characterization of the various aspects of MLNAF, however, offers new targets and we have shown in our in vivo animal studies that targeting Notch with gamma secretase inhibitors, and Src with Dasatinib, has significant efficacy, . The consistent feature of all of the variant fusion kinases, however, is the activation of the FGFR1 kinase, which provides an opportunity to use inhibitors of this function to treat MLNAF.\\n\\nFGFR1 belongs to a large group of protein tyrosine kinases that play crucial roles in controlling cell growth, differentiation and survival, among other functions. There have been two reports describing targeting FGFR1 in MLNAF using either PKC412 or TKI258 . PKC412 (Midostaurin), a multiple serine\\\/threonine and tyrosine kinases inhibitor, was shown to have efficacy in the treatment of one MLNAF patient carrying the ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusion gene. However, it appears that this compound lacks specificity for FGFR activity at the 500 nM (IC50 dose) used. TKI258 (Dovitinib) was shown to specifically inhibit proliferation and survival of the KG1 and KG1A cell lines carrying the FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 chimeric kinase, as well as primary cells from 4 MLNAF patients associated with different FGFR1 rearrangements. Recently, Ponatinib (AP24534), a potent, orally active inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase and its mutants, was also shown to be effective against FGFR tyrosine kinase activity at nanomolar concentrations, although not specifically in the context of MLNAF rearrangements. Ponatinib is currently being investigated in a phase II clinical trial for patients with CML (http:\\\/\\\/clinicaltrials.gov NCT01207440). Here we show that Ponatinib effectively inhibited the activation of several different FGFR1 fusion kinases and their downstream effectors, resulting in cell growth inhibition and apoptotic death. In these studies, Ponatinib was more effective than TKI258 in inhibiting in vitro growth of the human MLNAF KG-1 cells. Importantly, Ponatinib treatment resulted in statistically significant prolonged survival in ZMYM2-FGFR1 and CEP110-FGFR1 models of MLNAF in syngeneic transplantation mouse models. Ponatinib was also effective against human KG1 cells in an immunocompromized murine xenotransplantation model. These data indicate that Ponatinib may be effective in the treatment of neoplasms associated with chimeric FGFR1 kinases, and perhaps for other human disorders associated with deregulated FGFR1 activity.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsInhibitorsPonatinib was obtained from Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; PD173074 was obtained from Cayman Chemical; TKI258 (dovitinib) and PKC412 (midostaurin)) were purchased from LC laboratories. All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C before use.\\n\\nStable transformation of BaF3 cellsCells from the BaF3 murine pro-B cell line were stably infected with ZMYM2-FGFR1, BCR-FGFR1, CEP110-FGFR1 or the control MIEG3 vector as described previously. Using the same protocol we also established BaF3 cells stably expressing CUX1-FGFR1 (a kind gift from Dr. Els Lierman, Department of human genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) and FGFROP2-FGFR1 which was cloned from human KG1 cells. The FOP1-FGFR1 fusion gene was synthesized from its individual component parts and fused using a 6 bp linker following PCR amplification. All transformed BaF3 cells co-express GFP and show IL3 growth independence.\\n\\nCell culture and proliferation assaysAll cell lines were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) with 5% FBS (Hyclone), at 37\\u00b0C in 10% CO2.

Cell cycle analysis was performed using standard Flow cytometry procedures following either propidium iodide staining alone, or together with BrdU incorporation. These cells were then stained with anti-BrdU-APC (eBioscience), as described previously .\\n\\nFlow cytometry analysisSpleen tissues were passed through a cell strainer (BD, Bedford, MA) to generate single cell suspensions. Bone marrow cells were isolated by flushing mouse femurs with PBS and stained using specific conjugated monoclonal antibodies (). For intracellular staining of phospho-Stat5, cells were fixed and permeabilized before reacting with a phospho-Stat5 (Y694) antibody (BD Biosciences) according to standard procedures. Following staining, cells were washed once in staining medium and then analyzed using an LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).\\n\\nImmunoprecipitation and western blot analysesProteins were isolated as described previously. Whole-cell lysates (50 \\u03bcg) were separated using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific antibodies (details available on request). To detect phospho-FGFR1, 500 \\u03bcg of each whole-cell lysate was first immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR1 antibody (Santa Cruze Biotechnology) and followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Sigma).\\n\\nMolecular analysesTotal RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and retro-transcribed with a QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Amplification was performed using standard PCR (New England Bio.) in combination with specific primers and conditions which are available on request.\\n\\nAnimals and treatment scheduleIn the first experiment, female Balb\\\/c mice (Harlan 6\\u20138 weeks old) were injected with ZNF112 or CEP2A cells at 2 \\u00d7 106 per mouse through the tail vein. One week after injection, mice were randomized to treatment with vehicle or Ponatinib (20 mg\\\/kg\\\/day). Ponatinib was dissolved in 25 mM citrate buffer (pH 2.75) according to the manufacturer\\u2019s suggestion, and given orally using a gavage needle twice daily. The control group of mice was given an equal volume of the citrate buffer by gavage. All treatments were performed 6 days per week for 4 weeks.

The chemical is converted into 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide and gives rise to three main DNA adducts, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4AQO, 3-(desoxyguanosin-N (2)-yl)-4AQO and 3-(deoxyadenosin-N (6)-yl)-4AQO. This study was designed to assess the shape of the dose-response curve at low concentrations of 4NQO in three human lymphoblastoid cell lines, MCL-5, AHH-1 and TK6 as well as the mouse lymphoma L5178Y cell line in vitro. Chromosomal damage was investigated using the in vitro micronucleus assay, while further gene mutation and DNA damage studies were carried out using the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase forward mutation and comet assays. 4NQO showed little to no significant increases in micronucleus induction in the human lymphoblastoid cell lines, even up to 55\\u00b15% toxicity. A dose-response relationship could only be observed in the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y after 4NQO treatment, even at concentrations with no reduction in cell viability. Further significant increases in gene mutation and DNA damage induction were observed. Hence, 4NQO is a more effective point mutagen than clastogen, and its suitability as a positive control for genotoxicity testing has to be evaluated for every individual assay.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionGenetic toxicology involves the assessment of a substance\\u2019s ability to induce DNA damage, which is an essential consideration for human health risk assessment because DNA damage is an underlying cause of mutations that have the potential to initiate carcinogenesis. It is essential to investigate and understand the biological significance of genotoxic effects of chemicals at the low-dose exposure range to improve human health risk assessment and to establish if DNA reactive compounds follow linear or non-linear dose\\u2013response relationships.\\n\\nTraditionally, high concentrations of genotoxins were used in in vitro testing to ensure that DNA damaging effects were identified and because of the assumption that genotoxins follow a linear relationship that was extrapolated back to the low-dose region (). However, in recent years, the linear model was challenged (), and it became apparent that inappropriately high concentration in genetic toxicology testing was responsible for many of the false-positive results in Stage 1 in vitro testing (,). In vitro genetic toxicity assays have been extensively used in safety assessment studies and have contributed to our understanding of the dose\\u2013response relationships of aneugens, clastogens and point mutagens (). Genotoxicants can interact with DNA by various mechanisms, such as direct interaction of the compound with DNA, interaction of the compound with cellular components that cause indirect DNA damage and DNA damage can also be induced through activation of the compound by cellular metabolism to produce products, which are capable to subsequently interact with DNA ().\\n\\n4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) is a known mutagen and carcinogen and is therefore used in various genotoxicity assays as a positive control (). The chemical was first synthesised in 1942, and its carcinogenicity was first demonstrated in 1957 (,). Since then, 4NQO has widely been used in experimental oncology as a potent carcinogen (). It is known that 4NQO induces cancer in various tissues in mice and rat, examples of which are lung, pancreas and stomach (). Chemically, 4NQO is comprised of two polar groups, the N-oxide and nitro group. It is therefore susceptible to nucleophilic attack in chemical reactions (). The enzymatic reduction of its nitro group is believed to cause 4NQO\\u2019s carcinogenic effect. 4NQO is converted into 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide (4HAQO) and 4-aminoquinoline 1-oxide (4AQO); however, only 4HAQO is believed to be carcinogenic (). 4NQO and its reduced metabolite 4HAQO are able to bind to cellular macromolecules, such as nucleic acid and protein (). The activated 4HAQO gives rise to three main adducts by reacting with purines, but not with pyrimidines (); of these adducts, two are located within the guanine base and another adenine adduct is also formed. The structures of adducts identified were nucleic acid bases, nucleosides or nucleotides of N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4AQO, 3-(desoxyguanosin-N\\n2-yl)-4AQO and 3-(deoxyadenosin-N\\n6-yl)-4AQO (,). The dGuo-C8-AQO adduct results from an attack of the nitrenium ion on the C8 position of guanine, whereas the dGuo-N2-AQO and the dAdo-N6-AQO adducts results from a carbocation attack on the guanine N2 and the adenine N6 positions, respectively (). It is known that 4NQO reacts primarily with DNA at the N2 and C8 position of guanine and to a smaller extent at the N6 position of adenine (). Further, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation has been reported in cellular DNA treated with 4NQO (,), and it has been shown that 4NQO also induces oxidative stress and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide radicals or hydrogen peroxide (,).\\n\\nThis study was designed to assess the shape of the dose\\u2013response curve at low concentrations of 4NQO in human and mouse cells in vitro and to investigate the effects of using different study designs on the points of departure (PoD) and genotoxic potency. Chromosomal damage was investigated using the in vitro micronucleus (MN) assay, while further gene mutation and DNA damage studies were carried out using the hypoxanthine\\u2013guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) forward mutation and comet assays. Comparative studies were performed in two laboratories, Swansea University, Swansea, UK and AstraZeneca, UK.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsTest agent4NQO was acquired from Sigma\\u2013Aldrich (Dorset, UK) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). Before use, the chemical was freshly diluted from a stock solution (2.5mg\\\/ml aliquots at Swansea University and 0.019mg\\\/ml aliquots at AstraZeneca) with DMSO.\\n\\nCell lines and culture conditionsAt Swansea University, the human lymphoblastoid cell lines, MCL-5, AHH-1 and TK6, were utilised. AHH-1 is a human lymphoblastoid TK+\\\/\\u2212 cell line that constitutively expresses a high level of native CYP1A1 (). AHH-1 cells carry a heterozygous mutation in the TP53 locus (). The human lymphoblastoid cell line MCL-5 is derived from AHH-1 by stable transfection with human cytochromes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (). These cytochromes and a hygromycin B resistance gene are carried as cDNAs in plasmids incorporated into the cell. Further, MCL-5 cells carry, like AHH-1 cells, a heterozygous mutation in the TP53 locus. The human lymphoblastoid cell line TK6 is a derivative of the WIL-2 cell line and contains the wild-type TP53 gene. For the experiments carried out at AstraZeneca, TK6 and the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y were used. L5178Y cells are known for their dysfunctional p53 activity (,). TK6 cells showed a composite karyotype of 47 XY, +der3t(3,21), +der13t(13,22) and \\u221214+der14t(14,20), while L5178Y cells showed a composite karyotype of 40 X0 der5t(5,15), der9t(9,6) Robertsonian fusion 12 and 13, del 14+15(t15,5), +15(t15,18,14), der15, \\u221215q and der 18t(18,6).\\n\\nThe average doubling time of TK6 cells in both laboratories was ~16 to 18h. The doubling time of AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells was ~22 to 24h, whereas the L5178Y doubling time was ~11.5h.\\n\\nAt Swansea University, all cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GibCo\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% donor horse serum (BD Gentest, Oxford, UK) and 1% l-glutamine (GibCo\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Cells were maintained at 37\\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For MCL-5 cells, hygromycin B (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in acetic acid (35mM) was added at each passage to a final concentration of 200 \\u00b5g\\\/ml to ensure plasmid retention ().\\n\\nTK6 cells at AstraZeneca were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma\\u2013Aldrich, Dorset, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor horse serum (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 2mM l-glutamine (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 2mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 200 IU\\\/ml penicillin (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 200 \\u00b5g\\\/ml streptomycin (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2. L5178Y cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor horse serum, 2mM l-glutamine, 2mM sodium pyruvate, 1% Pluronic F68 (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 200 IU\\\/ml penicillin and 200 \\u00b5g\\\/ml streptomycin at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2.\\n\\nTreatment with test agentFor the in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells were treated with 4NQO over a range of concentrations up to 0.7 \\u00b5g\\\/ml for 4h, followed by one cell cy\n\nRespond with a JSON array of objects in this format:

The main elements that WAT employs in this regulative role are: a) its large capability to store energy as triacylglycerols, depleting circulating levels [], a function that extends in part to the removal of excess glucose [] used for lipogenesis []; b) its ability to reverse the storage process, releasing fatty acids to the bloodstream through lipolysis []; c) the modulation of other (and self) tissues through the secretion of hormones and paracrine agents []; and d) the wasting of energy, a postulated role [] traditionally attributed to brown adipose tissue, and insufficiently characterized in WAT.\\n\\nOleoyl-estrone (OE) is a signalling molecule from WAT that has been postulated as a ponderostat modifying agent [], since its administration induces a severe wasting of the body fat reserves [], reducing WAT lipogenesis and substrate uptake rather than elicit increases in lipolysis, increasing fatty acid output []. This process is in part mediated, at least in liver, by SREBP1c [], under conditions in which glycolysis is not completely blocked irrespective of a large availability of fatty acids []. Notwithstanding, basically the OE mechanism of action remains largely unknown.\\n\\nThe combined administration of a specific \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist with OE results in an assumedly synergistic effect of both agents inducing a massive WAT wasting, but nevertheless maintaining the circulating levels of the main metabolic indicators within the normalcy range []. OE reduces WAT mass at the expense of a decrease in energy intake with maintained thermogenesis [,], whilst most \\u03b23-adrenergic agonists elicit a massive lipolysis to fuel an increased thermogenesis, but barely affect food intake [], and tend to show limited effects because of downregulation of the receptors [].\\n\\nThe discovery of \\u03b23-adrenergic receptors in brown and white adipose tissue [] generated an enormous research effort to obtain agonists for these receptors that could elicit an increase in thermogenesis without the dangerous secondary effects of unspecific \\u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [,]. A large number of compounds were obtained [] but none was finally commercialized because of the short-time span of their efficacy and the rapid down-regulation of the receptors []. There is a number of \\u03b23-adrenergic agonists available that show very little superposition in their effects with \\u03b21 or \\u03b22 receptors. We had previously used CL316,243 [] in a previous gross-energy study, in combination of OE, and found that this combination deeply affected the body energy reserves []. As a continuation, the purpose of this study is to check how WAT responds to the double challenge, determining whether there is a common sharing of pathways for WAT energy disposal, or their actions upon the tissue follow separate strategies. Finally, we also wanted to know whether there is (or not) a synergistic effect favoring the depletion of body fat when using the combined slimming agents approach.\\n\\nMethodsAnimals and experimental setupMale Wistar rats (Harlan-Interfauna, Sant Feliu de Codines, Spain) of 45 days were used. The rats were maintained under standard conditions (21-22\\u00b0C, 60-50 % relative humidity, and 12 h light\\\/dark cycle: on from 08.00) in three-rat cages, and were fed for five weeks a simplified cafeteria diet []ad libitum. As previously described [], at the end of this phase the rats were already overweight; the animals were re-conditioned to eat standard pellet diet as sole food during an additional week (maintenance chow, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain).\\n\\nFour groups of six animals, initially weighing 360-380 g, were randomly selected: a) Controls; b) oleoyl-estrone: OE; c) \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist (B3A) CL316,243: B3A; and d) oleoyl-estrone and \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist: OE+B3A. Groups B3A and OE+B3A were implanted on day 0 subcutaneously in the back with an osmotic Alzet minupump (type 2002, Alzet, Palo Alto CA, USA) under isoflurane anaesthesia; the minipumps were loaded with B3A, the \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist CL316,243 [](Sigma, St Louis, MO USA) dissolved in saline. The minipumps released B3A at a rate of 0.5 \\u03bcl\\\/h in the subcutaneous space, at a dose of 1 mg\\\/kg and day. The rats in the OE and OE+B3A groups received a gavage containing OE (OED, Barcelona, Spain) in 0.2 ml sunflower oil, at a daily dose of 10 \\u03bcmol\\\/kg. The gavage of rats in the control and B3A groups contained only oil. The rats were given the gavages at the beginning of the light cycle, and were maintained under standard housing conditions, with full access to water and food pellets; their weight and food consumption were recorded daily. The treatments continued for 10 days.\\n\\nAt the end of the experiment, the rats were killed by decapitation. The rats were dissected and samples of inguinal, retroperitoneal and epididymal WAT were rapidly taken, frozen in liquid N and weighed. Then, the three WAT pads (inguinal subcutaneous, retroperitoneal and epididymal) were completely dissected, blotted and weighed in order to obtain the total mass of each WAT site. Tissue samples were maintained at -80\\u00b0C until used\\n\\nThe experimental setup and procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Barcelona. All animal handling procedures were carried out following the guidelines established by the EU, and the Spanish and Catalan Governments.\\n\\nNucleic acid analyses, cellularityTissue samples were used for the estimation of total DNA, using a standard fluorimetric method with 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (Sigma, St Louis MO USA) and bovine DNA (Sigma) as standard []. Tissue DNA content allowed the calculation of the number of cells per g of tissue and in the whole tissues sampled, based on the assumption that the DNA content per cell is constant in mammals; here we used the genomic DNA size data [] for somatic rat cells (5.6 pg\\\/cell). Mean cell mass was estimated from the number of cells and the tissue weight.\\n\\nTotal tissue RNA was extracted using the Tripure reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis IN USA), and were quantified in a ND-100 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington DE USA).\\n\\nSemiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expressionRNA samples were reverse transcribed using the MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, W I USA) and oligo-dT primers. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) amplification was carried out using 0.010 mL amplification mixtures containing Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA), equivalent to 8 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA and 300 nM primers. Reactions were run on an ABI PRISM 7900 HT detection system (Applied Biosystems) using a fluorescent threshold manually set to OD 0.500 for all runs. W e analyzed the expression of the genes listed in the Additional File  Table S1, which includes the list of primers used.\\n\\nA semiquantitative approach for the ultimate estimation of the number of copies of each expressed gene mRNAs per tissue weight was used as previously described []. ARBP was used as charge control gene in all samples. All primers were selected and optimized to obtain values of r \\u2265 0.98, resulting in an efficiency range of 93-104 %.\\n\\ncAMP analysisFrozen tissue samples were homogenized in chilled perchloric acid 30 g\\\/L [] using a Polytron tissue disruptor (ultraturrax, Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland); after neutralization with 2N NaOH, supernatants were used for a cAMP binding assay using a specific kit (TRK432, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Results for cAMP were expressed in amol\\\/cell; cAMP data, as well as specific gene mRNA content in the tissue were expressed as absolute data of content in the whole of the specific fat pad, as a way to specifically discriminate the global WAT site response to the stimuli regardless of cell size or number, parameters that may be also influenced by the treatments [,].\\n\\nStatistical analysisIn addition to the three sites studied, a fourth group of data was included, corresponding to the sum of the three sites. The data were obtained tabulating the experimental results for each animal. Statistical two-way ANOVA analyses was carried out using the Prism 5 program package (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA USA), with a limit of significance of P < 0.05. Spot comparisons between groups were done using the unpaired Student's t test.\\n\\nResultsBody weight, tissue cellularity and cAMP levelsFigure  shows the changes in body weight and food intake elicited by the 10-day pharmacologic treatment. Control rats increased their weight by a 2.4 \\u00b1 0.7 %; OE rats lost 13.7 \\u00b1 1.4 %, B3A lost 2.2 \\u00b1 2.5 % and OE+B3A lost 11.7 \\u00b1 1.0 % in 10 days; the effect of OE was significant (P < 0.0001) but not that of B3A; there was a significant (P = 0.0468) interaction between both agents (two-way ANOVA). Food intake in controls was a mean 18.6 \\u00b1 0.8 g\\\/day, in the B3A group it was slightly decreased (16.3 \\u00b1 1.1 g\\\/day), and showed even lower values in the OE (8.4 \\u00b1 0.6 g\\\/day) and combined OE+B3A (12.8 \\u00b1 0.9 g\\\/d) groups; the effects of OE on food intake were statistically significant (P < 0.0001), but not those of B3A (two-way ANOVA).\\n\\nFigure 1Body\n\nRespond

Exposure to estrogenic chemicals is a well-documented risk to human health based on the experience with prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) and its effects on development of the female reproductive tract (FRT). Many estrogenic compounds are found as environmental contaminants at levels sufficient to have adverse effects on human health. Phytoestrogens in the diet or nutritional supplements are common sources of environmental estrogen exposure (). The most abundant dietary phytoestrogens are the isoflavones genistein (Gen) and daidzein, which are present in soybean-derived products (). Even in strict vegetarians, adult serum isoflavone levels are low (\\u2264 0.5 \\u03bcM) and should have minimal estrogenic activity (; ).\\n\\nIn contrast to adults, infants fed soy-based formula have relatively high serum isoflavone concentrations; in a recent study,  found that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles in serum were 1.5, 3.3, and 5.4 \\u03bcM, respectively, and the highest concentration was 13.2 \\u03bcM. In animal models these levels are clearly estrogenic, as indicated by uterine wet weight bioassays (). Two prospective studies demonstrate that soy-based infant formula elicits estrogenic responses in the developing human female (; ). Limited epidemiological information is available regarding long-term effects of infant exposure to soy-based formulas, but in a recent large study,  reported an increased incidence of physician-diagnosed fibroids by 35 years of age. These studies suggest that neonatal exposure to phytoestrogens or other environmental estrogenic chemicals could have a long-term effect on adult female reproductive health.\\n\\nFRT development is similar in most mammals, although the timing of morphogenesis differs among species. In the mouse, the FRT develops from the M\\u00fcllerian duct beginning on gestation day (GD) 13 (). Prenatal FRT development is controlled by several transcription factors and secreted signaling glycoproteins of the Wnt (wingless-related MMTV integration site) and hedgehog families. Anterior\\u2013posterior (AP) patterning of the M\\u00fcllerian duct is regulated by positional information derived from the Hoxa (homeobox A cluster) family of homeobox transcription factors. Expression of these genes becomes spatially restricted before birth, and distinct FRT regions eventually develop that correlate with increased expression of specific Hoxa genes: Hoxa9 in the oviduct, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 in the uterus and upper cervix, and Hoxa13 in the lower cervix and vagina (; ; ).\\n\\nEpithelial cell differentiation in the mouse FRT begins after birth and continues until adulthood. At birth, the oviduct is a simple tubular structure with a single layer of columnar epithelium. During the neonatal period, this epithelium differentiates into secretory or ciliated columnar cells in response to cues received from the underlying mesenchyme that vary along the AP axis (). These differences result in distinct patterns of epithelial morphogenesis such that the oviduct infundibulum and ampulla consist largely of ciliated epithelial cells, whereas the isthmus has more secretory cells. Similarly, uterine and vaginal mesenchymal cells generate cues that determine the epithelial cell types in those regions, with the adult uterus having mainly simple columnar cells and the vagina developing a stratified squamous epithelium ().\\n\\nThe neonatal FRT is highly sensitive to estrogenic disruption during morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. Numerous studies performed in animal models show that prenatal or neonatal exposure to estrogenic compounds causes dramatic alterations in FRT development and can lead to FRT cancers (). To determine whether exposure to environmentally relevant phytoestrogens has similar effects on FRT development and function, we used a mouse model of subcutaneous Gen exposure on postnatal days (PND) 1\\u20135 (50 mg\\\/kg\\\/day). As long as the final serum Gen concentration is similar, the effects of Gen derived from oral exposure during the neonatal period are comparable to those observed when Gen is administered subcutaneously (). This model generates serum Gen levels [maximum concentration (Cmax) in female pups, 6.8 \\u03bcM] similar to those found in human infants fed soy-based infant formula (; ). As adults, these mice have multioocyte follicles, lack regular estrous cycles, and are infertile even after superovulation, and approximately 30% develop uterine cancer (; ). Abnormalities in both the oviduct and uterus contribute to the infertility phenotype. Although the mice become pregnant, approximately 50% of the preimplantation embryos die in the oviduct after the two-cell stage, and the uterus does not support implantation (). The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that neonatal Gen treatment causes permanent changes in oviduct gene expression and morphology that could explain the oviduct\\u2019s contribution to infertility.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsAnimals and treatments. All animal procedures complied with National Institutes of Health\\\/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences animal care guidelines; animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. Mice were fed NIH-31 mouse chow (Zeigler Brothers, Gardners, PA), which was assayed for phytoestrogen content as previously described (). Female CD-1 pups were injected subcutaneously on PND1\\u2013PND5 with corn oil (control) or Gen (50 mg\\\/kg\\\/day; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), ICI-182780 (ICI; 1 mg\\\/kg\\\/day; Sigma), or ICI (1 mg\\\/kg\\\/day) 30 min before Gen (50 mg\\\/kg\\\/day). Gen was prepared in a suspension of corn oil at 5 mg\\\/mL, and ICI was dissolved in corn oil at 1 mg\\\/mL. All treatments were delivered in 20 \\u03bcL corn oil, and doses were calculated based on a pup weight of 2.0 g. At 6\\u20138 weeks of age, the female mice underwent superovulation [equine chorionic gonadotropin followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), both at 5.0 IU in 0.1 mL saline; both from Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ] or superovulation and mating as described previously (). Only plug-positive mated females were used in experiments requiring pregnant mice.\\n\\nReal-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples were collected as follows (n = 3\\u20136 independent biological replicates per group). On PND1, oviducts, uteri, and cervix\\\/vagina from five mice were pooled per biological replicate. On PND5, oviducts, uteri, and cervix\\\/vagina were collected 4 hr after the last treatment; oviducts from three mice were pooled per biological replicate, but uterus and cervix\\\/vagina samples were from individual mice. For PND22 pups and adults, both oviducts from one mouse were pooled per biological replicate. For adult nonpregnant mice, oviducts of superovulated females were collected before (8 hr after hCG) and after (15 hr after hCG) ovulation, and cumulus masses were removed. For adult pregnant mice, oviducts of superovulated females were collected on GD2 or GD4 (48 hr or 96 hr after hCG, respectively), and embryos were removed. For untreated adult FRT samples, oviducts (pair), uterus, cervix, and vagina collected from one mouse per biological replicate.\\n\\nTotal RNA was isolated, and cDNA was generated from 1 \\u03bcg RNA using standard protocols. Primers were designed to amplify exon junctions. RT-PCR was performed on 20 ng cDNA using SYBR\\u00ae Green\\u2013based detection on an ABI 7200 HT sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative gene expression was calculated by the \\u0394Ct method () using cyclophilin A (Ppia) expression for normalization.\\n\\nMicroarray analysis. Oviducts were collected on GD2 (48 hr after hCG), and embryos were removed. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gene expression analysis was conducted on four independent biological replicates for each group using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome 4 \\u00d7 44 multiplex format oligo arrays (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Slides were scanned with an Agilent Scanner, and data were obtained using Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 9.5), which performed error modeling, adjusting for additive and multiplicative noise. The resulting data were processed using Rosetta Resolver\\u00ae (version 7.2; Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) and deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no. GSE27639; NCBI, Bethesda, MD).\\n\\nHistology and immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed tissues were paraffin embedded and sectioned at 5 \\u03bcm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Masson\\u2019s trichrome according to standard protocols. For Pitx1 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1) immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline\\\/Tween 20 (TBST). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Pitx1 antibody () was diluted 1:150 in TBST containing 1% BSA and 1% milk. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), ExtrAvidin (1:50; Sigma), and NovaRED (Vector) were used for detection. For E-cadherin immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked with 10% horse serum and avidin\\\/biotin blocking reagent (Vector), and E-cadherin antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:150 dilution. The secondary antibody was from the Vectastain Elite Kit (Vector), and diaminobenzidine was used for visualization.\\n\\nImmunoblotting. Total oviduct protein (5 \\u03bcg\\\/mouse in each lane) was separated on Novex 4\\u201312% Tris-glycine gels and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Blots were blocked with 5% milk in TBST and then incubated with either Six1 [sine oculis-related homeobox 1 homolog (Drosophila); 1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK] or \\u03b2-actin (0.2 \\u03bcg\\\/mL; Sigma) primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase\\u2013conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersha\n\nRespond with a JSON array of objects in this format:

Most studies have used high doses of a single compound and short exposure periods, generally during the critical uterine or neonatal period. However, humans and wild animals are exposed simultaneously to various environmental and food EDCs, generally at low levels, throughout their lives. Therefore, it would be valuable to determine the effects of a chronic exposure to low doses of EDCs on the reproductive axis and to identify the mechanisms involved. In particular, it is not known whether lifetime exposures to low (environmental) doses of estrogenic \\u201cfeminizing\\u201d and antiandrogenic \\u201cdemasculinizing\\u201d EDCs can have adverse effects on male reproductive function of the same magnitude as those of acute exposure to high nonenvironmental doses of these compounds in isolation.\\n\\nIn this study, we used a rat model of prolonged exposure to EDCs by gavage to determine the effects on male reproduction of two EDCs that may be associated in the human diet: the phytoestrogen genistein and the antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin. Genistein is an estrogenic isoflavonoid found in leguminous plants (). It is particularly abundant in diets containing soya or soya-derived products, leading to a dietary exposure of up to 2 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day; for infants fed milk formulas containing soya, dietary exposure can reach 1 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day (). In previous studies involving transient gestational, lactational, or adult intakes (), rodents have been exposed to various doses of genistein but the findings are equivocal: some report male reproductive anomalies (), whereas other do not (; ). Human exposure to genistein may affect the responsiveness and sensitivity to other xenobiotics, particularly environmental estrogenic chemicals () and other endocrine-active dietary contaminants. Vinclozolin, a dicarboximide fungicide extensively used on fruit and vegetables, is recognized as a human diet contaminant acting\\u2014essentially through its two main metabolites M1 and M2\\u2014as an androgen-receptor (AR) binding antagonist (, ; ). A recent French study reported that 20% of 139 meal samples from work canteens contained measurable levels of vinclozolin (). In addition, assays of metabolites in urine revealed that > 80% of a population in central Italy was exposed to noticeable levels of vinclozolin and similar pesticides (). Vinclozolin administered to experimental animals in vivo at various doses, by various routes, and for exposure periods (gestation, lactation, puberty, adulthood) produces a wide spectrum of reproductive defects: reduced anogenital distance (AGD); persistent nipples; cleft phallus; hypospadias; cryptorchidism; reduced weights of the ventral prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis; and reduced sperm counts (; ; ). It is highly plausible that vinclozolin can induce such anomalies of the reproductive tract in humans (). However, most studies used doses 100 times the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 1.2 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day based on a combination of chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity in rats ().\\n\\nTo our knowledge, only one recent study has investigated the reproductive consequences (the frequency of hypospadias) of in utero exposure to both genistein and vinclozolin (). Using a lifelong exposure scheme, we found significant alterations of reproductive development and impairment of several fertility end points by these compounds, the most severe effect resulting from combined exposure to a dietary level of genistein and a level of vinclozolin lower than the U.S. EPA-proposed NOAEL. In addition, we found that mRNA expression profiles in the adult testis are notably and differentially modified according to the exposure protocol. We also describe functional clustering of the genes affected into ontologic families.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsChemicalsGenistein with a purity of 99% was synthesized at the Laboratoire de Chimie Organique et Organom\\u00e9tallique (Universit\\u00e9 Bordeaux 1, Talence, France). We extracted vinclozolin from the commercial formulation Ronilan (BASF France, Levallois-Perret, France) according to . The extract was dried under vacuum and then recrystallized from methanol. Vinclozolin has a melting point of 108\\u2013109\\u00b0C and its purity, as verified by HPLC-diode-array detection (from 192 to 400 nm) and gas chromatography\\\/mass spectrometry analyses, was > 96% (data not shown). In addition, we tested the absence of the degradation products M1 and M2 by liquid chromatography\\\/mass spectrometry as previously described ().\\n\\nDoses usedThe exposure scheme consisted of a \\u201chigh\\u201d and a \\u201clow\\u201d dose for each compound, and the corresponding combinations. The high doses we used were higher than the reported NOAEL of vinclozolin and the plausible levels of genistein in the human diet; we chose these doses to be sufficiently low to maintain normal growth, as well as food and water intake. The genistein high dose, 10 mg\\\/kg body weight (G10), was greater than the genistein levels found in human diets in Southeast Asia () and was several times lower than the doses used in some reproductive studies; the low dose, 1 mg\\\/kg body weight (G1), was similar to that in soya-based diets (). The vinclozolin high dose, 30 mg\\\/kg body weight (V30), was substantially greater than real-life exposure levels but was 3\\u201310 times lower than the doses used in several male reproductive studies (). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of vinclozolin is 600 \\u03bcg\\\/day\\\/person, corresponding to an exposure of 0.01 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day (). In France, the estimated daily intake is 3.3 \\u03bcg\\\/kg\\\/person (), which is < 1% of the ADI. The low vinclozolin dose used in the present study, 1 mg\\\/kg body weight (V1), was higher than human food contamination levels; however, it was lower than the NOAEL combining chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity in rats (1.2 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day; ).\\n\\nAnimals and regimensA total of 80 specific-pathogen free (SPF) female and 32 SPF male Wistar Han rats at 8 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan France Sarl (Gannat, France) and fed with a soy-free diet (Harlan Teklad, Gannat, France). On their arrival, they were acclimatized to the animal facility conditions (22\\u00b0C with constant humidity and a 12-hr light\\\/dark period) for 4 weeks before mating. All animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. They were maintained in accordance with the French Ministry of Agriculture guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. From the acclimatization period, animals were fed a purified diet of pellets (18% casein, 46% starch, 23% sucrose, 5% corn oil, 2% cellulose, 5% mineral mixture, and 1% vitamin mixture) and supplied with water ad libitum. dissolved in corn oil (Carrefour, Dijon, France) and administered by gavage (2 mL\\\/kg body weight). Control animals were treated with the vehicle alone. Animals were identified by a unique ear tag with a randomly assigned number.\\n\\nExposure conditionsWe randomly assigned 10 females to each treatment group and mated them with male rats (five females and two males per cage) with the aim of obtaining at least 20 adult male offspring per treatment group for subsequent data comparisons and analyses. We examined females daily and caged them separately when a vaginal sperm plug was observed [defined as gestational day (GD) 1]. From GD1 until weaning [postnatal day (PND) 21], the dams were gavaged daily with the chemical preparations and then killed under anesthesia. On the day of parturition, all litter sizes were standardized to 10 offspring. From weaning (PND21) to adulthood (PND80), all animals were gavaged daily according to the various exposure protocols, and every 4 days they were weighed and inspected for anomalies.\\n\\nReproductive development end pointsOn PND25, we randomly selected five males from each group; the AGD was measured with a digital caliper, and the development of the penis was scored according to the procedure reported by . For both tests, the operator was blind to the treatment group.\\n\\nF1 mating and fertility end pointsOn PND80, six males per group were selected for mating with new unexposed acclimatized females (Harlan France Sarl); each male was housed with one female for 4 days. As described above, females were inspected daily; when a vaginal sperm plug was found, females were housed separately until parturition. We used the following fertility end points: mating index (number of mated females \\u00f7 number of females cohabited with males \\u00d7 100), fertility index (number of pregnant females \\u00f7 number of mated females \\u00d7 100), litter size, mean weight per neonate, sex ratio at birth, and percentage of postimplantation loss (number of embryonic scars \\u00f7 number of embryonic buttons and scars \\u00d7 100).\\n\\nSacrificeOn PND85, we anesthetized males using isoflurane (2.5%) and collected blood under heparin conditions from the dorsal aorta for subsequent hormonal tests. Animals were killed by thoracic cage opening. For each animal, both testes, epididymides and the seminal vesicles, ventral prostate, and liver were excised and trimmed of fat. We then weighed the tissues (Precisa model 125A; Precisa, Poissy, France) and calculated relative weights (weight of the organ in grams per kilogram body weight).\\n\\nSperm motility and motion characteristicsImmediately after epididymis separation, we excised approximately a 0.8-cm portion of the proximal part of the vas deferens and placed it in a Petri dish containing 4 mL of pre-warmed M199 medium (Gibco BRL, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). After incubating for 5 min at 37\\u00b0C, we swirled the Petri dish to facilitate the spontaneous release of sperm from the vas deferens. We loaded 10 \\u03bcL sperm suspension into an 80-\\u03bcm-deep, 2X-Cel disposable sperm analysis chamber (Hamilton-Thorne Research, Beverly, MA, USA). The device was placed on the heated stage (37\\u00b0C) of a computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) integrated visual optical system (Hamilton-Thorne Research).

Cell detachment from the extracellular matrix can induce apoptosis (anoikis) via inactivation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK).\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and emphysema are large global health problems with a high disease prevalence in smokers and individuals exposed to biomass fuel smoke. The pathobiological concepts of COPD\\\/emphysema take genetic and epigenetic risk factors into account and the modern concept of molecular disease mechanisms have recently been reviewed . A postulated lung structure maintenance program  provides a large enough conceptual framework for the integration of inherited and acquired mechanisms which can disturb the homeostatic balance which generally preserves the lung function even in individuals at an advanced age. A large body of experimental data characterizes the lung tissue destruction after varying periods of cigarette smoke exposure, however, few studies have addressed mechanisms of lung tissue destruction in non-smokers or animal models where emphysema occurs independent of smoke exposure , , and little is known about the role of dietary influences on lung structure maintenance.\\n\\nHere we investigate the impact of a copper-depleted diet and copper chelation on the integrity of the lung alveolar structures. Our studies have been inspired both by a human disease model, the X chromosome-linked, Menkes disease, which is characterized by an inherited copper transporter gene mutation and neonatal emphysema , and an animal model, the Blotchy mouse, which also develops emphysema. Underlying the mouse disorder are mutations in the Atp7a gene (the human homologue in Menkes disease is ATP7A), which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase , . Copper, an essential trace metal determines the activity of a number of critically important enzymes, among them: lysyl oxidase (LOX) and Cu-Zn SOD. Based on the many important functions of copper-dependent proteins we postulated that copper deficiency would lead to emphysematous lung tissue destruction, as previously reported in the rat and in the hamster , . Several mechanisms for the development of emphysema in copper deficient animals have been proposed, but not examined. Although impaired cross linking of matrix protein as a consequence of LOX inhibition provides a rather intuitive explanation for emphysema development in copper-deficient animals, the published data regarding LOX activity dependent emphysema are controversial. Kida et al. reported that administration of a LOX inhibitor caused emphysematous lesions in young rats , while Rubio et al. showed that LOX inhibition by itself did not cause emphysematous lesions in adult rats . Based on our investigations, we propose here a particular form of apoptosis, anoikis, as the mechanism of copper-deficiency emphysema. We show that copper-deficiency emphysema is associated with impaired expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1\\u03b1) target genes because of impaired HIF-1\\u03b1 transactivation, and we further show that copper deficiency causes a decreased expression and activity of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK).\\n\\nTaken together, the data derived from our animal model studies establish anoikis as a cause of emphysematous lung tissue destruction and also that proper function of FAK is required for the maintenance of the lung structure.\\n\\nResultsCopper depletion cause emphysema and lung cell apoptosisWe examined rat lung tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and found that copper depletion caused a significant emphysematous destruction of the lungs, which was uniformly present throughout the tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) treated rat lungs, and an increase of the mean alveolar airspace areas (MAAA) and mean linear intercept (MLI), compared to the control rat lungs (). By examining caspase-3 expression in the rat lung tissues, we found that the airspace enlargement was accompanied by caspase-3 expression (). Emphysematous lung tissue destruction is frequently attributed to activation of proteolysis and in particular to Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, yet our data do not support a role for MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the emphysema development in the copper depleted rat ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g001Figure 1Copper depletion by a copper chelator (tetrathiomolybdate:TTM) treatment causes emphysema and lung cell apoptosis.(A) Representative photomicrographs of HE-stained lung sections of control and TTM treated rats.

In addition, we found decreased expression of mRNA and protein levels of LOX, elastin, fibulin 1 (FBLN1) and fibrillin 1 (FBN1), whereas the expression of fibulin 5 (FBLN5) was increased (). Furthermore, we found decreased expression of integrin \\u03b26 mRNA expression in copper depleted rat lungs ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g003Figure 3Copper depletion decreases VEGF, lysyl oxidase (LOX), elastin, fibullin-1 (FBLN1), fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and integrin \\u03b26 expression in rat lungs.(A) The bar graphs show HIF-1a, VEGF, LOX, elastin, FBLN1, FBLN5 and FBN1 mRNA expression in TTM treated rat lungs measured by RT-PCR analysis, and quantified as a ratio of the expression in vehicle treated rats.

Whereas HIF-1\\u03b1 protein expression was decreased by copper depletion, the expression of the p300\\\/HAT (histone acetyl transferase) protein was increased by copper depletion (). To assess whether impaired HIF-1\\u03b1 binding to target genes could explain the reduced expression of VEGF and LOX in the lungs from copper depleted rats, the binding of HIF-1\\u03b1 extracted from the lung nuclear protein fraction to hypoxia responsive element (HRE) sequence expressing DNA was assessed. The results obtained using this binding assay indicate impaired lung tissue HIF-1\\u03b1 nuclear protein binding activity in the copper depleted lungs (). Because copper depletion caused in the lung tissue an increased expression of the HIF-1\\u03b1 coactivator p300, we addressed the possibility of impaired HIF-1\\u03b1\\\/p300 binding. Indeed, immunoprecipitation showed impaired HIF-1\\u03b1\\\/p300 binding (). Thus we present two separate- but likely linked- causes of impaired (by copper depletion) transactivation of HIF-1\\u03b1 target genes: decreased HIF-1\\u03b1 protein expression and impaired binding of the coactivating protein p300.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g004Figure 4Copper depletion affects lung tissue HIF-1a protein expression and its transactivational activity.(A) Representative Western blot analysis of HIF-1\\u03b1, histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), p300, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) and Lamin A\\\/C in lung protein extracts from TTM treated rats.

Memory impairment was produced by scopolamine (0.5 mg\\\/kg, i.p.) in animals. Morris water maze (MWM) test was employed to assess learning and memory. Brain acetylcholinestrase enzyme (AChE) activity was measured to assess the central cholinergic activity. The levels of brain thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were estimated to assess the degree of oxidative stress. Scopolamine administration induced significant impairment of learning and memory in rats, as indicated by a marked decrease in MWM performance. Scopolamine administration also produced a significant enhancement of brain AChE activity and brain oxidative stress (increase in TBARS and decrease in GSH) levels. Pretreatment of stevioside (250 mg\\\/kg dose orally) significantly reversed scopolamine-induced learning and memory deficits along with attenuation of scopolamine-induced rise in brain AChE activity and brain oxidative stress levels. It may be concluded that stevioside exerts a memory-preservative effect in cognitive deficits of rats possibly through its multiple actions.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionDementia is a syndrome of progressive nature, characterized by impairment of memory and loss of intellectual ability. The dementing condition that has received the utmost attention in the past decade is Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), which is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, accounting for 60\\u201370% of all cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 5% of men and 6% of women aged above 60 years suffer from dementia of AD worldwide.[] AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized in the brain by the presence of senile plaques rich in insoluble aggregates of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles. Loss of cholinergic neurons in nucleus basalis magnocellularis of cortex is one of the most prominent features of AD, primarily accounting for memory loss.[] Clinical management of dementia is still a nightmare for the neurobiologist. Thus far, cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, etc. are the mainstay of AD therapy. Antiinflammatory agents, antioxidants, nonsteroids and some neuroprotective agents have also been used, but with limited success.[] Most of the currently used therapeutic interventions provide only symptomatic relief and do not halt the progression of dementia; further associated side-effects also limit their use. Hence, there is a need for an agent that will not only provide relief but will also stop the progression of the dementia.\\n\\nStevioside, the major glycoside from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, has recently gained popularity because of its sweetening nature, being about 300-times sweeter than sucrose (0.4% solution).[] Various studies have revealed that in addition to its potential sweetening nature, it exert beneficial effects, including antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic, antihuman rotavirus, antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antitumor actions.[] However, its antiamnesic potential remains to be explored. Therefore, the present study has been undertaken to investigate the beneficial effect of stevioside in memory deficit of rats, employing scopolamine[] -induced amnesia as an animal model.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsAnimalsWistar rats of either sex, weighing around 150\\u2013200 g, were employed in the present study. They were procured from the Veterinary University, Ludhiana. The rats were provided standard laboratory feed (Kisan Feeds Ltd., Chandigarh, India) and tap water. They wee exposed to an alternate light and dark cycle of 12 h and had free access to food and water. The animals were acclimatized to the laboratory conditions for at least 5 days before the behavioral test. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) and care of the animals was taken as per guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of India.\\n\\nDrugs and ReagentsStevioside was purchased from Phyto-Organic, Ghaziabad, India. Folin-Ciacalteu\\u2019s phenol reagent was purchased from Merck Limited, Mumbai, India. 5,[] dithiobis (2-nitro benzoic acid) (DTNB), reduced glutathione (GSH), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and thiobarbituric acid were obtained from Loba Chem, Mumbai, India. Scopolamine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA. Scopolamine was dissolved in distilled water and administered intraperitoneally (i.p.).\\n\\nMorris-Water Maze Test (MWM)MWM test was employed to assess learning and memory of rats.[] The procedure described by Parle and Singh[] was used to assess the MWM performance of the animals. Escape latency time (ELT) in seconds was recorded and day 4 ELT was taken as an index of acquisition whereas day 5 time spent in target quadrant (TSTQ) served as an index of retrieval or memory.\\n\\nBiochemical ParametersCollection of tissue sampleThe animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the thoracic aorta and brain tissue were carefully removed. Thoracic aorta was used for endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation, whereas brain tissue was subjected to various biochemical estimations. The removed brains were homogenized in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 10% w\\\/v) using a Teflon homogenizer. The clear supernatant, obtained after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min, was used to estimate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) and GSH. Blood samples for biochemical estimation were collected just before sacrificing the rats.\\n\\nEstimation of brain AChE activityThe whole-brain AChE activity was measured by the method of Ellman et al. with slight modification.[] Change in absorbance per minute of the sample was read spectrophotometrically at 420 nm.\\n\\nEstimation of brain TBARS levelThe whole-brain TBARS level was measured by the method of Okhawa et al. with slight modifications.[] The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically (DU 640B spectrophotometer; Beckman Coulter Inc, Kraemer Boulevard, P.O.

Box 8000, Brea, CA, 92822-8000, USA) at 532 nm.\\n\\nEstimation of brain GSH levelThe whole-brain GSH level was measured by the method of Beutler et al. with slight modifications.[] The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm.\\n\\nExperimental ProtocolFour groups, each comprising of seven Wistar rats, were employed in the present study.\\n\\nGroup I (control group): Rats were administered normal saline 30 min before acquisition trials for four consecutive days and 30 min before retrieval trial (on day 5).\\n\\nGroup II (scopolamine-treated control group): Rats were administered scopolamine (0.5 mg\\\/kg, i.p.) 30 min before acquisition trial conducted from day 1 to day 4 and then vehicle (distilled water) only 30 min prior to retrieval trial conducted on day 5.\\n\\nGroup III (stevioside per se): Rats were administered stevioside (250 mg\\\/kg, orally) 30 min before acquisition trial conducted from day 1 to day 4 and then vehicle (distilled water) only 30 min prior to retrieval trial conducted on day 5.\\n\\nGroup IV (stevioside + scopolamine-treated group): Rats were treated with stevioside (250 mg\\\/kg, orally) 30 min before the administration of scopolamine. The remainder of the procedure was similar to that of Group II.\\n\\nStatistical AnalysisThe results are expressed as mean \\u00b1 standard error of means (S.E.M.). The data of behavioral results were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Tukey\\u2019s multiple range test using Sigma Stat Statistical software version 3.5. A P-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\\n\\nResultsVarious pharmacological interventions employed in the present study did not show any significant mortality. Further, no significant difference was observed between the results obtained from rats of either sex.\\n\\nEffect on ELT and TSTQ Using MWMControl animals showed a significant decrease in their day 4 ELT as compared to its value noted on day 1 [], reflecting acquisition (learning). Further, these mice significantly spent more time in the target quadrant (Q4) in search of missing platform as compared to the time spent in other quadrants (Q1, Q2, Q3) during retrieval trial conducted on day 5, indicating memory or retrieval [].\\n\\nTable 1ELT effect of stevioside on scopolamine-induced changes in ELT using MWM\\n\\nGroupDoseDay 1 ELTDay 4 ELT(seconds)(seconds)Control10 mL\\\/kg (p.o.)89.2 \\u00b1 2.3449.6 \\u00b1 2.17Scopolamine treated0.5 mg\\\/kg (i.p.)83.8 \\u00b1 2.4592.6 \\u00b1 4.44Scopolamine + stevioside0.5 mg\\\/kg (i.p.) + 250 mg\\\/kg (orally)86.7 \\u00b1 2.4560.9 \\u00b1 2.45Stevioside250 mg\\\/kg (orally)90.2 \\u00b1 3.6252.5 \\u00b1 3.47Values are mean \\u00b1 S.E.M\\n\\na= P<0.05 vs. day 1 ELT in control rats\\n\\nb= P<0.05 vs. day 4 ELT in control rats\\n\\nc= P<0.05 vs. day 4 ELT in scopolamine-treated rats\\n\\nFigure 1Effect of stevioside on scopolamine-induced changes in time spent in target quadrant using Morris water maze.

Beside the acute risk of unwanted detonation, there is a chronic risk of contamination, because the metal vessels corrode and the toxic and carcinogenic explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT) and metabolites) leak into the environment. While the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity of TNT and its derivatives occurs through its capability of inducing oxidative stress in the target biota, we had the idea if TNT can induce the gene expression of carbonyl reductase in blue mussels. Carbonyl reductases are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase\\\/reductase (SDR) superfamily. They metabolize xenobiotics bearing carbonyl functions, but also endogenous signal molecules such as steroid hormones, prostaglandins, biogenic amines, as well as sugar and lipid peroxidation derived reactive carbonyls, the latter providing a defence mechanism against oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we identified and cloned the gene coding for carbonyl reductase from the blue mussel Mytilus spp. by a bioinformatics approach. In both laboratory and field studies, we could show that TNT induces a strong and concentration-dependent induction of gene expression of carbonyl reductase in the blue mussel. Carbonyl reductase may thus serve as a biomarker for TNT exposure on a molecular level which is useful to detect TNT contaminations in the environment and to perform a risk assessment both for the ecosphere and the human seafood consumer.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionTrinitrotoluene (TNT) is one of the most used explosives worldwide, nowadays and in the past, both in civil and military activities (Juhasz and Naidu ; Beck et al. ). Since World War I, military munitions have been entered into the marine environment through two different ways: First, during war actions like fired but not exploded ammunition or munitions as a load on sunken vessels and shot down fighter aircrafts (Beck et al. ); second, by sea-dumping of munitions after World Wars I and II, since the involved nations were faced with a nearly uncountable number of ammunitions and other explosive materials produced by themselves or leftovers from the defeated nations (Beck et al. ). Today, as a consequence of these actions, we have to face several problems with regard to munitions in the seas. In addition to the risk of unwanted explosions, the most serious problem is that due to the corrosion of the munitions housings, toxic chemicals are being released and enter the marine environment. Porter et al. () detected TNT and other explosive chemicals not only in sediment and water but also in biota such as for example in different kinds of corals, dusky damselfish (Stegastes adustus) and sea urchin (Diadema antillarum) collected at the naval gunnery and bombing range of Isla de Vieques, Puerto Rico.\\n\\nTNT is toxic to all organisms. In humans, TNT and metabolites are mutagenic and of relevant urothelial carcinogenicity as well as toxic to the liver, kidneys, eyes, skin, blood system and spleen (Bolt et al. ). Many studies have shown acute and chronic toxic effects on marine species like shrimp, fish, copepods, corals, amphipods and bivalves (Nipper et al. ; Rosen and Lotufo ; Ek et al. ; Lotufo et al. ). Recently, Koske et al. () proofed the genotoxicity of TNT using zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Schuster et al. () demonstrated negative multilevel biological effects in the Baltic blue mussel (Mytilus spp.). Interestingly, the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity of TNT and its derivatives occurs through its capability of inducing oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the target biota (Bolt et al. ). In HepG2 and HepG3 cells, ROS formation by TNT causes DNA damage and induces apoptosis (Liao et al. ). Another study demonstrated that TNT induces oxidative stress in mouse, rat and human hepatoma cells (Naumenko et al. ).\\n\\nOxidative stress is able to perform peroxidation reactions of lipoproteins and lipids, thereby producing reactive carbonyl compounds which lead to modifications of DNA, lipids and proteins (Esterbauer et al. ). Detoxification by enzymatic carbonyl reduction of reactive carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, therefore, is a well-working defence mechanism. This reaction is catalysed by enzymes from two different protein superfamilies, referred to as aldo\\u2013keto reductases (AKR) (Penning ) and short-chain dehydrogenases\\\/reductases (SDR) (Persson et al. ).\\n\\nA subgroup of the SDRs, the carbonyl reductases, are of particular importance in the defence against oxidative stress and are particularly dealt with in this publication. Human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1; SDR21C1) was first characterized by Wermuth (). Later, human carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3; SDR21C2) was identified by Watanabe et al. (). While neurodegenerative disorders in humans like Parkinson\\u2019s, Alzheimer\\u2019s, Creutzfeld-Jakob and Huntington\\u2019s diseases are obviously aggravated by oxidative stress in the brain (Sayre et al. ; Dawson ), human CBR1 may contribute to neuroprotection due to its ability to metabolize reactive carbonyls derived from lipid peroxidation (Maser ). The role of CBR1 and CBR3 in the protection against ROS is underlined by their inducibility under conditions of oxidative stress (Ebert et al. ; Miura et al. ). In addition, toxic chemicals with impact on the environment like paraquat and even treated sewage are able to increase carbonyl reductase expression in Oncorhynchus mykiss and Zoarces viviparus (Albertsson et al. , ).\\n\\nIn previous investigations, TNT and its metabolites 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) were detected in blue mussels (Mytilus spp.) which had been exposed for several weeks in three active biomonitoring studies at Kolberger Heide (Strehse et al. ; Appel et al. ; Maser and Strehse ) (Fig.\\u00a0). Bivalves, as filter-feeding organisms are able to concentrate chemicals in their tissues, are robust and survive under moderate levels of different pollutants (Farrington et al. ). In many biomonitoring studies, mussels are, therefore, used as bioindicators for environmental pollution (Strehse and Maser ). On the other hand, with regard to marine pollution by TNT and its metabolites, specific biomarkers are urgently sought to detect TNT contaminations in the environment and to perform a risk assessment both for the ecosphere and the human seafood consumer.Fig. 1Location of the study site Kolberger Heide at the entrance to Kiel Fjord in northern Germany in the western Baltic Sea\\n\\n(source: www.google.de\\\/maps)\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on these facts that TNT exerts its toxicity through the development of oxidative stress and ROS, on the one side, and that the genes of carbonyl reductase are upregulated in their expression by ROS, on the other, we examined in the present approach whether the corresponding gene in the mussel is induced by TNT and whether carbonyl reductase is able to act as a specific biomarker in blue mussels for TNT detection. To answer this question, identification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp. as well as laboratory exposure studies towards TNT and field experiments were performed.\\n\\nMaterial and methodsIdentification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp.For identification and cloning of the Mytilus spp. carbonyl reductase gene and to obtain the optimum primer sequences for its amplification a BLAST search for carbonyl reductase genes on Mytilus genomic data and various genomes of model organisms was performed. From the resulting \\u201cproposed\\u201d gene sequence (Fig.\\u00a0) primers were designed (Table ) to obtain the coding sequence of the carbonyl reductase gene of Mytilus spp. used in the present study. Of note, the Mytilus species occurring in the western Baltic Sea are obviously a hybrid form of Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus edulis (Stuckas et al. ).Fig. 2Identification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp. M_CR_p \\u201cproposed\\u201d sequence of the carbonyl reductase gene, M_CR_s sequence of the carbonyl reductase gene after cloning and verification by Sanger sequencing, H_CBR1 sequence of human carbonyl reductase CBR1 from NCBI (GenBank accession number CR541708.1)\\n\\nTable 1Primers designed for RT-PCR\\n\\nPrimer nameGenBank accession noForward primer (5\\u2032\\u20133\\u2032)Reverse primer (5\\u2032\\u20133\\u2032)Amplicon size (bp)CRaATGGCAAAAAGAGTTGCAATTGTGTGGAAGCATTGCTAAATACACTGGTG76518\\u00a0s RNAL33448CAACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGTTATTGGAGCTGGAATTACCGCGG605aNo accession number for the \\u201cproposed\\u201d sequence of carbonyl reductase (CR) is given\\n\\n\\n\\nTo verify the bioinformatical outcome Sanger sequencing was performed.
