On the other hand, Collagen type 10 (Col10a1) and its transcription factor Runx2 (Runt-related transcription factor 2) are specifically expressed by hypertrophic differentiating chondrocytes [, ]. Cyclooxygenases, also known as prostaglandin H synthases, are enzymes that catalyse the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2, a rate-limiting step in the generation of prostaglandins [, ]. Prostaglandin H2 (PGH2) is converted by specific synthases to the main prostaglandin subgroups PGD2, PGE2, PGI2, PGF2\\u03b1 and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), which can be converted into various other intermediates [, ]. To date three COX isoforms have been described: COX-1, COX-2 and COX-3. The first two are the most prevalent and best described isoforms []. The COX-3 isoform is a splice variant of COX-1; however there is much debate on the function of COX-3 [\\u2013]. Both COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms catalyse the same enzymatic reactions and are structurally related []. They have remarkable differences regarding their tissue distribution, expression levels and their ability to respond to various stimuli [, , ]. COX-1 is constitutively expressed by most mammalian cells and regarded as the \\u201chousekeeping\\u201d cyclooxygenase. On the other hand, COX-2 expression is low in most tissues but can be rapidly induced upon exposure to various stimuli such as inflammation, mechanical stress and injury [, ] due to inducible enhancer elements in its promoter [].\\n\\nStudies investigating the roles of cyclooxygenases and the effects of prostaglandins on (in vitro) chondrogenic differentiation have mainly focussed on COX-2 (inhibition) and PGE2 [\\u2013]. However, the contribution of COX-1 and other prostaglandins in chondrogenic differentiation is largely ignored. Given their different roles in cellular prostaglandin synthesis, it is not unlikely that the two COX enzymes are differently involved in determining the outcome of the chondrogenic differentiation process.\\n\\nWe have previously shown that COX-2 expression is transiently upregulated during the first hours in chondrogenic differentiation of progenitor cells [] and a second time later in differentiation, when its expression coincidences with chondrocyte extracellular matrix synthesis []. In addition, we found that inhibition of COX-2 enzymatic activity results in a reduction of the hypertrophy outcome of the chondrogenic differentiation process []. However, whether this observation is specific for COX-2 and how this relates to COX-1 activity and specific prostaglandin involvement is unclear.\\n\\nWe hypothesized that COX-1 and COX-2 have differential roles in the chondrogenic differentiation process of progenitor cells and that their specific inhibition will thereby differently influence the outcome of the differentiation process. The characterisation of the function of the COX-enzymes and prostaglandins holds the promise to gain a deeper understanding of the chondrogenic differentiation process and thereby may uncover novel chances to influence cartilage tissue regeneration.\\n\\nMethodsImmunohistochemistryGrowth plates were isolated from tibias of 6 weeks old C57BL\\\/6 mice (approved by the local Animal Ethics Committee according to Dutch law; MUMC DEC approval 2008\\u2013042). Mice were euthanized using O2\\\/CO2 asphyxiation. The tibias were fixed in formalin and decalcified in 0.5 M EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) pH 7.8. Tibias were dehydrated, embedded in paraffin and five micrometer sections were cut. Sections were deparaffinized and antigen retrieval for COX-1 sections was performed by digestion with 0.4% hyaluronidase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 30 minutes at 37\\u00b0C. For COX-2 detection, sections were incubated in hot citrate buffer for 30 minutes. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated and sections were blocked with 10% normal sheep serum. Primary antibodies (anti-COX-1 (160110, Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, USA) and anti-COX-2 (610203, BD Transduction Laboratories)) were used in 1:100 dilution in PBS (Phosphate buffered saline). After washing in PBS-Tween20, bound antibodies were detected with HRP (horseradish peroxidase)-labelled secondary antibodies (Dako, EnVision+ System-HRP labelled Polymer). Bound secondary antibodies were visualized using DAB substrate (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). Stained sections were counterstained with Mayer\\u2019s Hematoxylin (Dako), dehydrated and mounted in Histomount (Thermo Shandon).\\n\\nATDC5 cultureATDC5 cells [] (RIKEN Cell Bank, Japan) were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2. Proliferation medium consisted of DMEM (Dulbecco\\u2019s modified eagle medium)\\\/F12 (Life Technologies, Bleiswijk, the Netherlands), 5% FCS (fetal calf serum) (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland), 1% antibiotic\\\/antimycotic (Penicillin\\\/Streptomycin; Life Technologies) and 1% NEAA (non-essential amino acids; Life Technologies). Differentiation medium comprised proliferation medium supplemented with 10 \\u03bcg\\\/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 10 \\u03bcg\\\/ml transferrin (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) and 30 nM sodium selenite (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were plated at 6400 cells\\\/cm2. Differentiation medium was changed every two days (day 0\\u201310) and daily (from day 10 onwards). To inhibit COX-1 activity SC-560 (1 \\u03bcM; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, USA) or Mofezolac (5 \\u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich) were used and applied during the differentiation process. Similarly, COX-2 activity was inhibited by NS398 (20 \\u03bcM; Cayman Chemical) or Celecoxib (10 \\u03bcM; LC laboratories). PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\\u03b1 and U-46619 (a TXA2 receptor agonist, herein referred to as TXA2) (Cayman Chemical) were applied daily during the differentiation process at 0, 0.1, 1 or 10 \\u03bcM concentrations. These concentrations were selected in the range of the highest concentrations reported in the culture supernatants of control differentiated t = 14 days ATDC5 cells. PGI2 (from the same manufacturer) was not applied in these experiments, as it is unstable in culture medium and therefore could not be used in a reliable manner.\\n\\nProstaglandin measurementProstaglandin concentration of PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 was determined in culture supernatants using ELISA\\u2019s according to the manufacturers\\u2019 protocol (Cayman Chemical). PGI2 concentrations could not be determined in a reliable manner by the ELISA\\u2019s from the same manufacturer and was therefore not included in these experiments.\\n\\nCOX specificity assayThe colorimetric COX inhibitor screening assay kit (Cayman Chemical) was used according to the manufacturers\\u2019 protocol to determine COX isoform-specific inhibitory capacity for SC-560, Mofezolac, NS398 and Celecoxib.\\n\\nRT-qPCRFor RNA isolation, cells were disrupted with 300 \\u03bcl Trizol (Life Technologies). RNA isolation, RNA quantification by UV-spectrometry (Nanodrop, Thermo Scientific), and cDNA synthesis were performed as described before [, ]. Real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed using Mesagreen qPCR mastermix plus for SYBR\\u00ae Green (Eurogentec, Seraing, Belgium). A CFX96 Real-Time PCR Detection system (Biorad, Hercules, CA, USA) was used for amplification: initial denaturation at 95\\u00b0C for 10 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of DNA amplification (denaturing for 15 seconds at 95\\u00b0C and annealing for 1 minute at 60\\u00b0C) followed by a dissociation curve. Data were analysed using the standard curve method, mRNA expression was normalized to a reference gene (\\u03b2-actin) and gene expression was calculated as fold change compared to day 0 (t = 0 in graphs). Validated primer sequences are depicted in .\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0153162.t001Table 1Primer sequences for RT-qPCR.Oligo setsForwardReverseCollagen type 2 (Col2a1)\\u20185-TGGGTGTTCTATTTATTTATTGTCTTCCT-3\\u2019\\u20185-GCGTTGGACTCACACCAGTTAGT-3\\u2019Collagen type 10 (Col10a1)\\u20185-CATGCCTGATGGCTTCATAAA-3\\u2019\\u20185-AAGCAGACACGGGCATACCT-3\\u2019SRY (sex determining region Y)-box 9 (Sox9)\\u20185-AGTACCCGCACCTGCACAAC-3\\u2019\\u20185-TACTTGTAGTCCGGGTGGTCTTTC-3\\u2019Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2)\\u20185-CGATGAAGACCCCAACCCTAA-3\\u2019\\u20185-ACTGGTAATGGCATCAAGGGATA-3\\u2019Cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1)\\u20185-TCCTCACAGTGCGGTCCAA-3\\u2019\\u20185-AAGGCCTCCCAGCTGATGTAG-3\\u2019Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2)\\u20185-GGCCATGGAGTGGACTTAAA-3\\u2019\\u20185-AAGTGGTAACCGCTCAGGTG-3\\u2019\\u03b2-Actin\\u20185-ACAGGATGCAGAAGGAGATTACTG-3\\u2019\\u20185-CCACCGATCCACACAGAGTACTT-3\\u2019The 5\\u2019\\u2013 3\\u2019 forward and reverse oligonucleotide sequences used for RT-qPCR are listed\\n\\nImmunoblottingCells were washed with 0.9% NaCl and lysed in RIPA buffer. Extracts were sonicated on ice using the Soniprep 150 (MSE, London, UK) at amplitude 10 for 14 cycles (1 second sonication and 1 second pause). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (13,000 x g, 4\\u00b0C). Protein concentration was determined using the BCA protein assay (Sigma-Aldrich). Polypeptides were separated by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; samples were equally loaded) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting. Primary antibodies (all 1:100 dilution) for immunodetection were polyclonal goat anti-Col2a1 (1320\\u201301, Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL, USA), polyclonal rabbit anti-Col10a1 (234196, Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany), polyclonal rabbit anti-Sox9 (ab 3697, Abcam), mouse monoclonal anti-Runx2 (D130-3, MBL, Woburn, USA) and mouse monoclonal anti-\\u03b1-Tubulin (T6074, Sigma-Aldrich; 1:10.000 dilution). Bound primary antibodies were detected with secondary immunoglobulins conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako) and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). ECL signals were quantified using ImageJ 1.46f software, and relative differences, corrected for background and housekeeper, were determined as compared to control conditions.\\n\\nGAG contentCells were washed with 0.9% NaCl and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. GAG deposition was detected by alcian blue staining. Fixed cells were incubated overnight with 1% alcian blue (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) in 0.1 M HCl. Alcian blue was extracted from the cells by incubation with guanidine-HCl (6 M) for 2 hours under continuous agitation. Extracted alcian blue was determined spectrophotometrically at 645 nm using a plate reader (Biorad).\\n\\nStatisticsIn the figures bars represent average value of 3 individual experiments (performed in triplicate) and error bars represent mean \\u00b1 standard error of mean (s.e.m.). Statistical significance (p <0.05) was determined by ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc analysis using GraphPad PRISM 5.0 (La Jolla, CA, USA).\\n\\nResultsExpression of COX-1 and COX-2 during chondrogenic differentiationTo examine the involvement of COX-1 and COX-2 during chondrogenic differentiation, spatiotemporal expression of these enzymes was first determined in murine growth plates. Expression of COX-1 and COX-2 was specifically detected in chondrocytes located in the hypertrophic zone of the growth plate, whereas COX-2 was also detected in cells in the resting zone (). To verify these results, we analysed expression of COX-1 and COX-2 during chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells. ATDC5 differentiation follows a well-defined and -established endochondral program from undifferentiated chondroprogenitor to hypertrophic chondrocyte [\\u2013]. Col2a1 and Sox9 were increasingly expressed from day 7 onwards in ATDC5 differentiation, establishing chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells. Moreover, Sox9 expression was also increased early in differentiation (first hours) (). Expression of chondrocyte hypertrophic genes Runx2 and Col10a1 increased from day 7 and day 10 onwards, respectively (). COX-1 expression was increased in ATDC5 differentiation from day 7 onwards (), correlating with the expression timing of Col2a1 and Col10a1 (). COX-2 expression was transiently upregulated in the first hours of chondrogenic differentiation and increased again from day 7 onwards (). These data correlate with the growth plate expression patterns of COX-1 and COX-2 as well as with our previous findings [, ]. To functionally determine COX enzyme activity during ATDC5 chondrogenic differentiation the concentration of the prostaglandins PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 was determined in culture supernatants.  shows that PGD2 and PGE2 concentrations in the culture supernatant changed throughout differentiation; during the first hours\\\/days of differentiation levels quickly raised and decreased again, to increase after about a week again, resembling the bi-phasic expression dynamics of COX-2. PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 levels remained stably low during ATDC5 chondrogenic differentiation.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0153162.g001Fig 1Expression of cyclooxygenases during chondrogenic differentiation from progenitor cells.A: Expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in growth plates was determined by IHC.

For the COX-1 inhibitors these optimal concentrations were 1 \\u03bcM for SC-560 and 5 \\u03bcM for Mofezolac and for COX-2 inhibitors 20 \\u03bcM for NS398 and 10 \\u03bcM for Celecoxib ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0153162.g002Fig 2Specificity of COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors.The selectivity of SC-560 and Mofezolac for COX-1 over COX-2 and selectivity of NS398 and Celecoxib for COX-2 over COX-1 was determined using a COX-1\\\/COX-2 colorimetric inhibition assay. The inhibitory capacity was determined as \\u201c% inhibition\\u201d compared to a maximum activity control condition. Bars represent average inhibition percentages of COX-1 and COX-2. Measurements were done in triplicate and error bars represent the variances in inhibitory activity.\\n\\nTo determine how chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells responds to COX-1 versus COX-2 inhibition, the different isoform-specific COX inhibitors were added from the start of differentiation or from day 10 onwards (to determine whether a potential effect depends on the differentiation status of the chondrocyte). As compared to control conditions, inhibition of COX-1 from the start of differentiation resulted in decreased Col2a1, Col10a1, Sox9 and Runx2 mRNA and protein levels at day 14 in differentiation (). Inhibition of COX-1 from day 10 onwards resulted in similar, although less pronounced effects on expression of these genes. Inhibition of COX-2 starting at day 1 or day 10, on the other hand, did not lead to decreased expression of Col2a1 and Sox9 at day 14 in differentiation and even increased Col2a1 expression (for Celecoxib at both time points and for NS398 when added from day 10 onwards in differentiation) (). A similar trend was detected for Sox9, although not significant. Inhibition of COX-2 did however affect the expression of chondrocyte hypertrophy genes Runx2 and Col10a1 at day 14 in differentiation of ATDC5 cells, when COX-2 was inhibited from the start of the experiment []. Inhibition of COX-2 from day 10 onwards resulted in similar although less pronounced effects on these chondrocyte hypertrophy genes. GAG content was decreased due to COX-1 specific inhibition at day 14 in differentiation and no effect on GAG content was observed for the COX-2 specific inhibition ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0153162.g003Fig 3Effects of COX-1 and COX-2 specific inhibitors on chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells.A:.

(n = 3). * indicates p < 0.05.\\n\\nIn order to confirm successful COX-1 or COX-2 inhibition during chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells and to determine whether both isoforms are equally involved in specific prostaglandin synthesis, PGE2, PGD2, PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 levels were measured. As shown in  (upper left panel), inhibition of COX-1 as well as COX-2 from day 0 or day 10 onwards caused a significant reduction in the PGE2 concentration at day 14 in differentiation, with the most efficient inhibition caused by both COX-1 inhibitors. COX-2 inhibition (both from day 0 and day 10 onward) by NS398 or Celecoxib also resulted in reduced PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 levels, but had no significant effect on PGD2 levels. Interestingly, COX-1 inhibition from the start of differentiation in ATDC5 cells resulted in increased levels of PGD2, PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 at day 14 in differentiation (). In contrast, COX-1 inhibition from day 10 in differentiation onwards, did not significantly influence PGD2 levels, but again increased TXA2 levels, while PGF2\\u03b1 levels in this condition were decreased as compared to control. Although the inhibitors enzymatically interfere with COX-activity, potential feedback mechanisms responding to diminished COX-activity might influence the level of COX-1 and COX-2 expression. To address this possibility we measured expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNAs. Inhibition of COX-1 by SC-560 or Mofezolac from the start of differentiation did not influence COX-1 mRNA expression at day 14 in ATDC5 differentiation, however when COX-1 was inhibited from day 10 onwards a slight decrease in COX-1 mRNA expression was detected. Interestingly, COX-2 mRNA expression increased in all tested COX-1 inhibitory conditions (). In cells treated with COX-2 specific inhibitors, COX-2 mRNA expression itself was increased as well, whereas COX-1 mRNA expression remained unaltered.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0153162.g004Fig 4COX-1 and COX-2 specific inhibitors differentially influence prostaglandin levels during ATDC5 chondrogenic differentiation.Successful COX-1 or COX-2 inhibition by the inhibitors and possible differences in specific prostaglandin production was determined at day 14 in ATDC5 differentiation. NS398, Celecoxib, SC-50 or Mofezolac were added from the start of differentiation or from day 10 onwards. A: PGE2, PGD2, PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 medium concentrations were determined at day 14 in differentiation by prostaglandin specific ELISA.

(n = 3). * indicates p < 0.05.\\n\\nAddition of specific prostaglandins during chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cellsAs inhibition of COX-1 or COX-2 has different consequences on the chondrogenic outcome and appears to affect downstream specific prostaglandin synthesis differently, we tested whether these prostaglandins differently influence chondrogenic differentiation. To this end, increasing concentrations of prostaglandins PGD2, PGE2, PGF2\\u03b1 and TXA2 were added to differentiating ATDC5 cells. Addition of PGE2 and the highest concentration of PGF2\\u03b1 caused an increased expression of Col2a1, Col10a1, Sox9 and Runx2 mRNA and protein at day 14 in differentiation (). TXA2 addition specifically resulted in increased expression of the hypertrophic genes Col10a1 and Runx2 and had almost no effects on the expression of chondrogenic genes Col2a1 and Sox9. Expression of Sox9 and Runx2 was increased by addition of PGD2 but this did only result in an increased trend in Col2a1 and Col10a1 expression (). Furthermore addition of the individual prostaglandins resulted in increased COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA expression ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0153162.g005Fig 5Prostaglandins differently regulate chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 cells.Increasing concentrations of PGE2, PGD2, PGF2\\u03b1, TXA2 were added to differentiating ATDC5 cells.

(n = 3). * indicates p < 0.05.\\n\\nDiscussionThe majority of the studies reporting on the function of COX enzymes in cartilage and bone tissues focused on the function of COX-2 and PGE2 in mature chondrocytes and osteoblasts [\\u2013]. This leaves the role of COX-1 and other prostaglandins during chondrogenic differentiation from progenitor cells poorly studied.\\n\\nWe found that COX-1 and COX-2 presented differential temporospatial expression patterns in developing growth plates; both isoforms were abundantly expressed in the hypertrophic chondrocytes of the growth plate, whereas specifically COX-2 was additionally found to be expressed in resting zone cells. These findings are in part in contrast with previous findings reported by Brochhaussen et al. [] who reported abundant expression of COX-1 throughout the rat growth plate and increased COX-2 expression in proliferative and hypertrophic zone of rat growth plates. Our results from murine growth plates showed interesting parallels with our in vitro ATDC5 observations though. Here COX-1 expression was only upregulated late in chondrogenic differentiation whereas COX-2 expression showed an initial peak during early differentiation and expression increased again from day 7 in differentiation and further. Recently, we and others have shown that NF-\\u03baB signalling is essential for early chondrogenic differentiation and that early NF-\\u03baB activation is required for the transient expression of COX-2 during early differentiation [, ]. Taken the above transient early COX-2 expression into account and the increased presence of COX-2 in the resting zone cells of murine growth plates, it is tempting to speculate on the role for COX-2 early in chondrogenic differentiation. However, based on expression of chondrogenic genes, we did not find any differences for COX-2 inhibition between day 0 and day 10.\\n\\nThe partially distinct expression patterns for COX-1 and COX-2 may suggest differential involvement of the two COX isoforms in chondrogenic differentiation of ATDC5 progenitor cells. When COX-1 was specifically inhibited an overall decrease was found in induction of chondrogenic and hypertrophic genes as Col2a1, Sox9, Runx2 and Col10a1. Furthermore, chondrogenic gene expression responded similar when COX-1 was specifically inhibited late in differentiation, implying that COX-1 activity serves a crucial role during various phases of chondrogenic differentiation. These findings are supported by literature also showing adverse effects on proteoglycan synthesis and content when COX-1 was inhibited []. Notably, in accordance with the overall chondrogenic inhibitory effect by specific COX-1 inhibitors, COX-1 is generally regarded to function as a \\u201chousekeeper\\u201d, although the reason and mechanism behind the increased COX-1 expression during late\\\/hypertrophic differentiation remains to be elucidated [].\\n\\nInhibition of COX-2 activity from the start of differentiation specifically decreased expression of hypertrophic markers, while leaving chondrogenic markers unchanged. These findings confirm a specific involvement of COX-2 over COX-1 in chondrocyte hypertrophy []. An unanswered question however remains how COX-2 can be specifically involved in regulating chondrocyte hypertrophy over COX-1, while the sole task of both is the synthesis of the PGH2 substrate for the synthesis of specific prostaglandins by dedicated downstream enzymes. A possible explanation might be found in the housekeeping function of COX-1 and that inhibiting COX-1 causes deleterious effects on the chondrocyte\\u2019s PGH2 levels, while PGH2 synthesis by COX-2 might occupy only a small additional part of the cellular PGH2 pool. Alternatively, a differential involvement of COX-1 and COX-2 in the synthesis of specific prostaglandins could well be possible though, as we found that specific inhibition of COX-1 or COX-2 differently affected the secreted levels of specific prostaglandins in the culture supernatant. COX-1 inhibition showed decreased PGE2 concentrations but no effects or even increased concentrations were observed for the other prostaglandins. COX-2 gene expression was found to be upregulated under influence of COX-1 inhibition and might explain the increased prostaglandin levels by redundancy mechanisms, although this would still not explain why PGE2 is specifically inhibited by COX-1 inhibition as opposed to the other measured prostaglandins. Inhibition of COX-2 resulted in decreased levels of all the prostaglandins but PGD2. Possible cellular rescue of COX expression under inhibitory conditions appears not to be mutually reciprocal, as opposed to above; COX-1 expression did not increase in the COX-2 inhibited conditions and would thus not provide an explanation for the inability for COX-2 inhibitors to down regulate PGD2 levels. Presently we do not have an explanation for this observation.\\n\\nWe demonstrated that PGE2, PGF2\\u03b1 and in lesser extent also PGD2 (in the concentrations tested) have positive effects on chondrogenic and hypertrophic gene expression in ATDC5 cells, whereas addition of TXA2 resulted in increased hypertrophic gene expression only. Some of these observations are in line with the report from Jacob et al., who described a positive effect on chondrogenic outcome after addition of PGD2 and PGF2\\u03b1 []. However, PGE2 did not increase expression of chondrogenic markers in this report, whereas in our study it resulted in the most pronounced effects from all tested prostaglandins. Differences of culture models; redifferentiating mature articular chondrocytes versus differentiating progenitor cells could be responsible for this discrepancy. In line with our results, several studies show that the addition of PGE2 result in increased cAMP levels and PKA signalling [, ] which led to increased mesenchymal progenitor cell chondrogenesis. Similarly, addition of PGF2\\u03b1 resulted in an increase of chondrogenic marker expression in a rat chondrocyte cell line and mature chondrocytes [, ].\\n\\nAddition of TXA2, surprisingly, only increased hypertrophic marker expression. This correlates with the effects of the COX-2 specific inhibitors, which resulted in decreased TXA2 expression and specific decreased hypertrophic gene expression. This may point to a role for COX-2 in TXA2 production and chondrocyte hypertrophy, which will be subject of further study. Another interesting observation is increased Sox9 expression after PGD2 treatment, as it was previously described that PGD2 was able to induce Sox9 transcriptional activation and subsequent differentiation of sertolli cells via its adenylcyclase-coupled DP1 receptor induced cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) signalling, which resulted in phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of Sox9 []. Although we investigated a different cell type in our study, one micromolar PGD2 resulted in a similarly increased Sox9 expression, which likely explains the subsequently increased Col2a1 expression. However, whether the action of PGD2 in chondrocytes is executed by the same signalling cascade needs further investigation.\\n\\nThe herein presented data show that the various prostaglandins synthesized by differentiating ATDC5 progenitor cells exert very different effects on ATDC5 chondrogenic outcome. After verification in chondrogenically differentiating human progenitor cells, these results may challenge the use of various non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for progenitor cell-based cartilage regenerative medicine approaches, as slight differences in COX-selectivity between NSAIDs may lead to pronounced and unexpected differences in prostaglandin synthesis, which in turn will differentially affect the chondrogenic outcome of the differentiation process.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of

The main route of exposure to PCBs is through the gastrointestinal tract; however, little is known about the effects of PCBs on intestinal epithelial barrier functions.\",\"full-text\":\"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are among the most persistent and widespread environmental pollutants today. Currently, the amount of PCBs globally distributed throughout the environment is estimated at > 1.5 million metric tons (), and their bioaccumulation and bioconcentration in the food chain are well established. Indeed, the primary route of PCB exposure for most of the population is through dietary intake, with high-fish-consuming populations being at higher risk (). Studies performed on population cohorts in the Great Lakes region consistently report that individuals with high fish consumption have a higher PCB body burden that may be related to the alterations of prenatal and postnatal cognitive development, behavior, and childhood IQ (; ).\\n\\nVery little is known about the effects of PCBs on the gastrointestinal (GI) system. We propose that exposure to PCBs through diet may influence individual health outcome via alterations of tight junctions (TJs) that seal together the adjacent intestinal epithelial cells, leading to increased intestinal permeability. The small intestine is characterized by the presence of villi that contain epithelium, which functions as a highly dynamic and selective barrier between the outside environment and underlying tissue. TJs consist of an intricate combination of transmembrane (e.g., occludin) and cytoplasmic accessory proteins [e.g., zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1)] linked to the actin cytoskeleton. The function of TJs depends on the proper expression and localization of these proteins. For example, regional loss of occludin in the intestinal epithelium was noted in an experimental model of jaundice-induced gut barrier dysfunction (), and a decrease in ZO-1 expression was observed in hemorrhagic shock and resuscitation (). Loss of GI epithelial integrity has been associated with the pathogenesis of several acute and chronic diseases, including diabetes, allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases ().\\n\\nThe mechanisms of cellular and tissue toxicity of PCBs are not fully understood. However, PCBs are potent activators of oxidative stress; therefore, induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be one of the mechanisms contributing to gut dysfunction. Recent evidence implicates NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) as an important source of ROS (). Active NOX generates superoxide via one electron transfer from NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) or NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Excessive activation of NOX has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory tissue injury and disease ().\\n\\nThe aim of the present study was to evaluate the hypothesis that PCBs can disrupt gut integrity at the level of TJs. Mechanistically, our studies focused on the role of PCBs in activation of prooxidative NOX. Using in vitro and in vivo assays, we investigated whether exposure to individual PCB congeners can disrupt integrity of the intestinal epithelium via NOX-mediated disruption of TJ proteins.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsCell culture and PCB treatmentCaco-2 human colon adenocarcinoma cells were cultured in GlutaMax medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT), 100 U\\\/mL penicillin G, 100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL streptomycin, and 1% nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen). Cells were incubated with serum-free medium for 12 hr before treatment with PCB (1\\u201310 \\u03bcM) or vehicle [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); control]. For NOX inhibition experiments, Caco-2 cells were pretreated for 30 min with 0.5 mM apocynin (Invitrogen), followed by exposure to individual PCB congeners. PCB126 (3,3\\u2032,4,4\\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl), PCB153 (2,2\\u2032,4,4\\u2032,5,5\\u2032-hexachlorobiphenyl), PCB104 (2,2\\u2032,4,6,6\\u2032-pentachlorobiphenyl), and PCB118 (2,3\\u2032,4,4\\u2032,5-pentachlorobiphenyl) were purchased from AccuStandard (New Haven, CT).\\n\\nWe used PCBs at concentrations of 1\\u201310 \\u03bcM, with 5 \\u03bcM used in most experiments. Such concentrations of PCBs do not affect cell viability () and reflect serum PCB levels in acutely exposed human populations (3.4 \\u03bcM or 1 ppm) (; ).\\n\\nTransepithelial permeability and NOX activity assaysCells were seeded at high density (2 \\u00d7 105 cells\\\/cm2) on fibronectin-coated Transwell tissue culture inserts (12 mm diameter, 0.4 \\u03bcm pore size; Costar, Corning, NY). We assessed the transepithelial transfer of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran of 4 kDa molecular weight (FD-4; Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) as described previously (), after cells achieved confluence and established transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) values of 200\\u2013250 \\u03a9 \\u00d7 cm2.\\n\\nNOX activity was evaluated by a lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence method as described previously by . Intensity of chemiluminescence was measured using MikroWin2000 software and a CenrtoXS3 LB 960 Microplate Luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Oak Ridge, TN).\\n\\nImmunoprecipitation, Western blotting, and immunofluorescenceImmunoprecipitation and Western blotting were performed as described previously (). Protein lysates were loaded onto 10% SDS-PAGE precast gels, electrophoresed (120 V, 1 hr), and transferred onto a polyvinyl difluoride membrane (0.2 \\u03bcm) at 200 mAmp for 2 hr. Membranes were blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated in respective primary antibody (1:500 dilution) overnight at 4\\u00b0C. We obtained anti-ZO-1 and anti-occludin antibodies from Zymed Laboratories (Carlsbad, CA); anti-phospho-p47phox antibody from Abcam (Cambridge, MA); and anti-gp91phox (gp91 subunit) and anti-p47phox (p47 subunit) antibodies from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The next day, membranes were washed and incubated with species-specific horseradish peroxidase\\u2013conjugated secondary antibody (1:2,000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Proteins of interest were detected using ECL Plus (GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) and semiquantitated with UN-SCAN-IT gel (Silk Scientific Corp., Orem, UT, USA).\\n\\nFor immunofluorescence, cultures were fixed with ice-cold 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. Nonspecific binding was blocked by 10% goat serum (Sigma). Cells were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% Tween 20 and incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C with primary antibody diluted (1:100) in TBS. Cells were then incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, Texas red\\u2013conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG, or FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (1:1,000 dilution) for 1 hr at 25\\u00b0C. Images were viewed using a confocal microscope under identical instrument settings.\\n\\nAnimalsAll animal protocols in this study were approved by the Committee on Animal Care at the University of Kentucky. The animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. Male C57BL\\\/6 mice (12\\u201314 weeks of age; Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were housed under 12:12 hr light:dark conditions with access to food and water ad libitum. Animals were fasted overnight before PCB treatment (150 \\u03bcmol\\\/kg). The 150-\\u03bcmol\\\/kg dose results in plasma PCB levels of 5 \\u03bcM, reflecting the concentration that was used in vitro. Individual PCB congeners were dissolved in tocopherol-stripped safflower oil (Dyets Inc., Bethlehem, PA) and administered in a 0.1-mL volume via oral gavage using an 18-gauge gavage needle, 3 in. long, curved, 2.25 mm ball diameter (Popper and Sons, New Hyde Park, NY). Control animals received safflower oil vehicle. Mice were either sacrificed for tissue analysis or used in intestinal permeability experiments 24 hr after PCB or vehicle treatment.\\n\\nIntestinal permeabilityWe assessed gut permeability as described by . Briefly, mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and administered FITC-dextran [20 kDa (FD-20); 22 mg\\\/kg body weight in 100 \\u03bcL phosphate-buffered saline] via oral gavage. Blood samples were collected at 1, 3, and 5 hr after FD-20 administration. Plasma concentrations of FD-20 were determined at 485 nm (excitation) and 530 nm (emission).\\n\\nImmunohistochemistryAnalyses were performed on 1\\u20133 cm gastroduodenal segments, which were fixed in 10% (vol\\\/vol) formalin, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (6 \\u03bcm) using a Finesse microtome (Shandon Cryotome, Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The sections were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained using an adaptation of previously described methods ().\\n\\nStatistical analysisWe used SigmaStat 2.0 software (Jandel Corp., San Rafael, CA) for statistical analysis. Comparisons between treatments were made by one-way or two-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey\\u2019s pairwise multiple comparison procedure. Statistical probability of p < 0.05 was considered significant.\\n\\nResultsIndividual PCB congeners induce NOX activity via phosphorylation of the p47 subunitWe investigated the hypothesis whether NOX-mediated reactions are involved in PCB-induced cellular toxicity. We exposed Caco-2 cells to individual PCB congeners at the concentration of 5 \\u03bcM and assessed NOX activity using the lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence assay. All measurements were performed at the same time, immediately after the end of PCB exposure. As illustrated in , a 5-min exposure to all studied PCBs resulted in a significant increase in NOX activity by approximately 40%. However, NOX activity was similar to control values after treatment with PCBs for 15 or 30 min.\\n\\nAssembly of the active NOX complex is associated with phosphorylation of the p47 subunit and its translocation from the cytosol into the membrane fraction. Therefore, we measured p47 phosphorylation after PCB treatment of Caco-2 cells.  indicates that exposure to all studied PCBs for 5\\u201315 min resulted in an increase in phosphorylated p47 (p-p47) levels.\\n\\nProteins can be phosphorylated on tyrosine, serine, and\\\/or threonine residues. Therefore, we designed additional co-immunoprecipitation experiments to determine the type of p47 phosphorylation in response to PCB exposure. Treatment with PCB congeners for 5 min increased tyrosine, serine, or threonine phosphorylation (), with tyrosine phosphorylation being the most prominent type of phosphorylation. Pretreatment with the NOX inhibitor apocynin (0.5 mM) appeared to inhibit all three forms of p47 phosphorylation (data not shown).\\n\\nWe also performed immunoreactivity experiments in Caco-2 cells treated with individual PCB congeners for 5 min (). Consistent with Western blotting results, we observed an increase in p-p47 immunoreactivity in all PCB-treated cultures. The staining pattern suggests localization of p-p47 in the membrane fractions of Caco-2 cells ().\\n\\nTreatment with individual PCB congeners stimulates p47 translocation and its association with membrane subunits of NOXNOX activity requires not only phosphorylation of p47 but also its transfer from the cytoplasm into the membrane fraction and assembly with other NOX subunits into one complex. Therefore, we assessed these events in PCB-treated Caco-2 cells. After treatment with individual PCB congeners for 5 min, we fractionated Caco-2 cells to isolated membrane fraction. As shown in , exposure to individual PCBs markedly increased p-p47 levels in cellular membranes.\\n\\nIn addition, we evaluated the interactions between p47 and NOX subunits gp91 and p22 using immunoprecipitation approaches.  indicates that p47 associates with gp91 within 5\\u201315 min after treatment. We observed these effects in all PCB-exposed groups; however, the interactions between p47 and gp91 appeared to be the greatest in cells exposed to PCB118 and PCB153 for 15 min. In addition, we observed a strongly pronounced interaction between p-p47 and p22 NOX subunits at 5-min exposure for all studied PCBs (), further indicating the formation of the active NOX complex.\\n\\nNOX is involved in PCB-induced alterations of ZO-1 protein expressionThe barrier function of gut epithelium is regulated by specialized TJ protein networks that limit passive paracellular movement molecules between adjacent epithelial cells. To determine the influence of PCBs on TJ integrity, we treated Caco-2 cells with vehicle or individual PCB congeners at concentration of 1, 5, or 10 \\u03bcM for 24 hr and evaluated protein expression of ZO-1 and occludin. Occludin is a transmembrane TJ protein, whereas ZO-1 belongs to a group of so-called accessory TJ proteins that link the transmembrane proteins with the cytoskeleton.\\n\\nExposure to all PCB congeners employed in the present study resulted in a decreased expression of ZO-1 (). We observed these effects in Caco-2 cells exposed to individual PCBs at concentrations as low as 1 \\u03bcM. To assess the role of NOX in PCB-mediated alterations of ZO-1 expression, we pretreated Caco-2 cells with apocynin, a specific NOX inhibitor, 30 min before exposure to individual PCBs. As illustrated in , apocynin significantly protected against a decrease in ZO-1 expression in cultures treated with PCB118 and PCB126.\\n\\nIn addition to alterations in ZO-1 expression, treatment with PCB congeners also decreased occludin expression in Caco-2 cells (). However, apocynin was not effective in protection against these effects, suggesting that NOX is not involved in PCB-induced alterations of occludin expression.\\n\\nIndividual PCBs disrupt the barrier integrity of Caco-2 cells via the NOX-dependent mechanismTo better understand the functional ramifications of PCB-mediated activation of NOX, the next series of our experiments focused on permeability across Caco-2 monolayers. Cultures were grown to confluence on Transwell filters until the TEER values in the range of 200\\u2013250 \\u03a9 \\u00d7 cm2 were achieved around 14\\u201321 days after seeding. Then, cultures were exposed to individual PCB congeners at 5 \\u03bcM for 24 hr. Treatment with all PCB congeners used in the present study significantly increased Caco-2 permeability to FD-4 compared with control. Importantly, the PCB-induced permeability changes were attenuated by 30-min pretreatment with the NOX inhibitor apocynin at 0.5 mM ().\\n\\nOral administration of PCBs alters intestinal permeability and TJ protein expression in an animal modelIn the last series of experiments, we employed an in vivo experimental model of PCB exposure in which we administered individual PCBs by oral gavage to resemble the main route of human exposure through the food chain. Mice exposed to individual PCB congeners (150 \\u03bcmol\\\/kg body weight) for 24 hr showed statistically significant increased gut permeability compared with vehicle-treated controls (). The assay was performed by assessing FD-20 flux from the intestinal lumen into the plasma. Elevated plasma levels of FD-20 were apparent as early as 1 hr after FD-20 administration and reached statistical significance 5 hr after FD-20 treatment.\\n\\nTo explain the mechanisms of PCB-induced intestinal permeability, we examined the expression of TJ proteins in villi sections of the small intestine of treated mice. The control animals were characterized by prominent immunohistochemical staining for ZO-1 () and occludin (), indicating borders between adjacent enterocytes (arrows point to dense bars between cells in ). Oral gavage of PCB153, PCB118, or PCB104 did not appear to affect the overall morphology of villi. In contrast, the morphology of villi was highly distorted in PCB126-treated animals and included areas lacking the villus epithelium. Importantly, ZO-1 and occludin staining was markedly decreased, especially at the cell\\u2013cell borders, in the small intestine of animals exposed to PCB congeners. These alterations are important because loss of TJ protein expression between adjacent enterocytes may correspond to \\u201cleaky\\u201d epithelium. Indeed, PCB-induced morphological alterations of TJs and focal loss of villous epithelium correspond to functional permeability changes observed in .\\n\\nDiscussionAlthough diet remains the primary route of PCB exposure, little is known about the influence of PCBs on gut integrity. In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time that individual PCB congeners induce NOX activity leading to TJ disruption and increased gut epithelial opening. This is an important finding, as a \\u201cleaky\\u201d intestinal mucosal barrier is associated with numerous pathologies () and may increase PCB entry into the body. Moreover, PCB-mediated proinflammatory and oxidative-stress\\u2013related damage to the mucosal immune system and\\\/or intestinal epithelium may disrupt natural defenses and increase the passage of enteric pathogens across the epithelium into the circulation.\\n\\nROS and enhanced tissue oxidative stress appear to underlie the long-term toxicity of PCBs. For example, the markers of enhanced lipid peroxidation have been increased in Yusho victims 35 years after accidental poisoning with PCBs (). However, the cellular sources of PCB-induced ROS are not fully understood; therefore, we explored the effects of individual PCB congeners on NOX assembly and activity. This focus was supported by the recent observation that NOX is involved in PCB-induced ROS production in neutrophils (). In addition, evidence from our laboratory demonstrated that PCB-induced NOX activity is required for up-regulation of cell adhesion molecules in human brain endothelial cells (). Results of the present study show that treatment with both coplanar and non-coplanar PCBs markedly increased activity of NOX. The NOX system can be activated through several signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), protein kinase C (PKC), and Ca2+ (); thus, it is likely that different PCBs may stimulate different aspects of this pathway, resulting in final assembly of an active enzyme. Activation of NOX involves PKC-mediated phosphorylation and the recruitment of the cytosolic subunit p47 to the membrane. Functionally, p-p47 acts as an adaptor protein helping to increase the binding affinity of other NOX components, such as gp91 and p22 (). Consistent with these data from the literature, our results show that both coplanar PCBs (i.e., PCB126) and non-coplanar PCBs (i.e., PCB104, PCB118, and PCB153) stimulate phosphorylation of p47 and its interaction with other key NOX subunit proteins.\\n\\nWe next addressed the hypothesis that PCBs may act through the NOX mechanism to elicit TJ modulation within intestinal epithelium. These experiments were based on the observations that increased ROS can rapidly stimulate compartmental redistribution of occludin and ZO-1 in Caco-2 cultures (). Studies performed in our laboratory () and other () laboratories demonstrated that oxidative stress can alter the expression of TJ proteins acting through Ras and Rho redox responsive elements and activation of protein tyrosine kinase (). Importantly, exposure to PCBs can up- regulate activities of MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, or c-Src (, , ), that is, signaling mechanisms that may influence integrity of TJs (). Finally, proteolysis of TJ proteins by matrix metalloproteinases and ubiquitination- proteasome systems may also be responsible for PCB-induced changes in TJ protein expression ().\\n\\nWe observed that inhibition of NOX by apocynin protected against PCB-induced alterations of ZO-1 but not occludin expression. Such a differential effect indicates finely tuned regulation of TJ expression in epithelial cells. For example, occludin phosphorylation in epithelial cells is regulated by the balance between protein kinases (e.g., c-Src, PKC zeta, PKC lambda\\\/iota) and protein phosphatases 1 and 2A, as well as protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (). Thus, this complex system of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of occludin\\u2014rather than NOX-dependent reactions\\u2014might be the dominant mechanism regulating occludin expression.\\n\\nBecause in vitro studies cannot fully reflect the complexity of cytotoxicity of PCBs, we further investigated the role of PCBs on intestinal integrity using an intact physiological model. The experiments presented here indicate for the first time that oral exposure to PCBs can significantly increase intestinal permeability to FD-20. Moreover, this effect was associated with altered immunoreactivity for the TJ proteins ZO-1 and occludin. Disruption of gut integrity by PCBs may contribute to multiple long-term and short-term adverse effects. Initial disruption of gut integrity by PCB exposure may result in increased gut permeability to PCBs, resulting in elevated circulating levels of these toxicants. PCBs are believed to cross the gut epithelium via passive diffusion and enter into the lymphatic system (). A disrupted gut barrier is likely to increase concentrations of PCBs in the systemic circulation and lead to enhanced PCB accumulation in tissues.\\n\\nAnother consequence of PCB-induced disruption of epithelial integrity may be an increase in gut permeability to other substances and pathogens present in the gut mucosa (). Several gut pathogens have shown to be independently associated with alterations in TJs at the intestinal barrier (). For example, an experimental model of Escherichia coli injection demonstrated an increase in TJ permeability associated with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of TJ proteins ().  recently demonstrated that compromised intestinal barrier function induced by the bacterial virulence factor lymphostatin is mediated by the Rho GTPase signaling cascade. (Additionally, high circulating levels of enteric toxins have been shown to stimulate low-level systemic inflammation. Chronic, albeit low-level, systemic inflammation has been associated with several pathologies, including vascular disorders ().\\n\\nConclusionResults of the present study demonstrate for the first time that the intestinal epithelium is highly susceptible to oral administration of coplanar and non-coplanar PCBs. Exposure to PCBs can modulate intestinal epithelial cell functions by altering TJ protein expression and functional permeability. In addition, activation of NOX is a critical event in the signaling of PCB-induced cellular stress and cytotoxicity. Thus, our study indicates that oral exposure to coplanar or non-coplanar PCBs present a significant risk to intestinal epithelial integrity and may directly contribute to the systemic effects of these toxicants.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of

Considering the role of CMA in redoxtasis and proteostasis, we sought to determine if the transcription factor NFE2L2\\\/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2) has an impact on CMA modulation. In this work, we identified and validated 2 NFE2L2 binding sequences in the LAMP2 gene and demonstrated in several human and mouse cell types that NFE2L2 deficiency and overexpression was linked to reduced and increased LAMP2A levels, respectively. Accordingly, lysosomal LAMP2A levels were drastically reduced in nfe2l2-knockout hepatocytes, which also displayed a marked decrease in CMA activity. Oxidant challenge with paraquat or hydrogen peroxide, or pharmacological activation of NFE2L2 with sulforaphane or dimethyl fumarate also increased LAMP2A levels and CMA activity. Overall, our study identifies for the first time basal and inducible regulation of LAMP2A, and consequently CMA activity, by NFE2L2.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionIntracellular oxidized proteins can be eliminated by a selective type of autophagy termed chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). The main characteristic of this mode of autophagy is the presence of a lysosomal receptor called LAMP2A (lysosomal associated membrane protein 2A). Soluble cytosolic proteins bearing a KFERQ-like motif are recognized by HSPA8\\\/HSC70 (heat shock protein family A [Hsp70] member 8) [\\u2013]. HSPA8 delivers cargoes to the lysosome surface, where they interact with LAMP2A []. Then, LAMP2A multimerizes in the lysosomal membrane to form a translocation complex [], so that unfolded substrates can enter the lysosome, assisted by lumenal HSPA8, and eventually be degraded by lysosomal proteases [,]. The limiting step in the whole process appears to be the availability of LAMP2A receptor at the lysosomal membrane, as lysosomal LAMP2A levels have been reported to correlate with CMA activity, and knockdown or overexpression of LAMP2A results in a decrease or increase in CMA proportional to the levels of expression [,]. LAMP2A is one of the 3 proteins that originate from alternative splicing of the LAMP2 gene. All LAMP2A, LAMP2B and LAMP2C isoforms share an identical lumenal region but differ in their cytosolic and transmembrane tail []. These isoforms result from cell-specific yet unknown regulation of differential splicing [,] but experimental evidence supports the conclusion that LAMP2A is the only LAMP2 variant required for CMA [,].\\n\\nAlthough basal CMA activity can be detected in most cell types [], this process is maximally activated in response to stress. Activation of CMA is associated with increased levels of LAMP2A and its multimerization to form membrane translocation complexes, lysosomal enrichment in HSPA8 and relocation of lysosomes to the perinuclear region [\\u2013]. It has been reported that a mild oxidant environment activates the expression of Lamp2a [] and that this process is under the transcriptional regulation of NFAT in T cells []. However, a generic mechanism that might regulate the expression of LAMP2A under these circumstances remains unknown.\\n\\nNFE2L2\\\/NRF2 (nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2), participates in the control of metabolic redox processes including degradation of oxidized proteins. NFE2L2 controls the basal and stress-inducible expression of over 250 genes that share a common a cis-acting enhancer termed the antioxidant response element (ARE) []. These genes participate in several cytoprotective functions such as phase I, II and III detoxification reactions, glutathione and PRDX\\\/peroxiredoxin-TXN\\\/thioredoxin metabolism, NADPH production through the pentose phosphate pathway and ME (malic enzyme), fatty acid oxidation or iron metabolism []. Most of these reactions provide an armamentarium to control redox homeostasis. Importantly for this study, we and others previously reported that NFE2L2 can modulate the expression of several genes involved in macroautophagy [\\u2013]. Thus, we identified many NFE2L2-regulated genes involved in the different phases of the macroautophagy process, from cargo recognition to autolysosome clearance []. Considering this evidence and the role of CMA in the cellular response to oxidative stress [], it might be feasible that NFE2L2 also participates in the regulation of CMA, but this possibility has not yet been investigated.\\n\\nIn this study, we show for the first time that NFE2L2 is required for CMA activation through the transcriptional control of LAMP2A expression, revealing a molecular pathway that connects oxidative stress with CMA induction. Bearing in mind that oxidized proteins accumulate in aging and in several age-related pathological conditions [], when CMA activity has been shown to decline [,], this study provides a new strategy to activate CMA through NFE2L2 inducers to facilitate elimination of such damaged and otherwise toxic proteins.\\n\\nResultsNFE2L2 binds to functional antioxidant response elements (ares) in the LAMP2 geneWe searched the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements at UCSC (ENCODE) [] of the human genome for putative AREs in this gene (Figure 1a). The ENCODE database gathers experimental data from chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis of ARE binding transcription factors MAFF, MAFK and BACH1 although NFE2L2 is not analyzed. As shown in , some of these binding sites were located at histone acetylated and DNAse-sensitive regions in the LAMP2 gene, both factors being typical of active enhancers. We then used a Python-based bioinformatics analysis to scan these binding regions for the consensus ARE as established in the JASPAR database []. We detected 8 putative AREs in the LAMP2 gene (Table S1) and 3 of them showed a relative score higher than 85%, a commonly used threshold for transcription factor binding-site analysis [,]. Moreover, the analysis also retrieved already identified AREs in the bona fide target genes of NFE2L2, HMOX1 and SQSTM1\\\/p62 ().10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-T0001Table 1.Putative antioxidant response elements (AREs) with a relative score higher than the 85% in the LAMP2 gene.\\n\\nARELocalization of the potential AREMax ScoreRelative scorePutative binding sequenceRegion of the geneARE1chrX:119,596,430\\u2013119,596,44115.830.921ATGACACTGCAIntron 1ARE2chrX:119 619,599\\u2013119,619,61013.240.859TTGACTCAGCG5\\u02b9 UTR (\\u221216,500)ARE3chrX:119,619,560\\u2013119,619,57113.070.855ATGACAAACCA5\\u02b9 UTR (\\u221216,500)\\n10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-F0001Figure 1.NFE2L2 binds to 2 functional antioxidant response elements (AREs) in the LAMP2 gene. (a) Scheme of the LAMP2 gene showing the 3 splice variants: LAMP2A, LAMP2B and LAMP2C, from The Encyclopedia of DNA Elements at UCSC (ENCODE) for human genome. Putative AREs in the LAMP2 gene were identified taking as reference the available information from ChIP of ARE-binding factors MAFK, MAFF and BACH1. These regions were localized in 200\\u2013400 base-pair-long DNAse-sensitive and H3K27Ac-rich regions, i.e. most likely regulatory promoter regions. (b) HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for NFE2L2\\u0394ETGE-V5 (lacking the KEAP1 regulatory domain). ChIP analysis was performed with anti-IgG or anti-V5 antibodies and the potential AREs with the highest score, termed ARE1, ARE2 and ARE3 (), were analyzed by qRT-PCR. The figure shows representative data normalized as the fold of enrichment with the anti-V5 antibody vs. the IgG antibody. The presence of already known AREs in HMOX1, NQO1 and SQSTM1 was analyzed as positive control and ACTB, and a region of NQO1 that does not contain an ARE (NQO1*) were amplified as negative controls. (c), Luciferase reporter constructs carrying 3 tandem putative ARE sequences from the LAMP2 gene (i-iii) or a scramble sequence as negative control (iv) controlling the expression of luciferase. (d) nfe2l2-KO mouse embryo fibroblasts were co-transfected with the reporters in C and increasing amounts of NFE2L2\\u0394ETGE-V5 construct. Values were normalized to pTK-Renilla activity and presented as fold of change. Data are mean \\u00b1\\u00a0SD (n\\u00a0=\\u00a03). Statistical analysis was performed using Student\\u2019s t test. *p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05, ** p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.01 and *** p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001 vs. basal levels.\\n\\n\\n\\nTo validate the AREs with the highest score (termed ARE1, ARE2 and ARE3), we next performed ChIP analysis with NFE2L2. HEK293T cells were transfected with an expression vector for V5-tagged NFE2L2\\u0394ETGE. This construct lacks the KEAP1 regulatory domain (ETGE) in order to facilitate NFE2L2 stabilization, translocation to the nucleus and binding to target genes. NFE2L2 was immunoprecipitated with an anti-V5 antibody and anti-IgG as a negative control. NFE2L2 binding was analyzed by qRT-PCR employing as template the immunoprecipitated DNA and primers designed to specifically amplify ARE1, ARE2 or ARE3 (Table S2). NFE2L2 bound to well-known positive control AREs in HMOX1, NQO1 and SQSTM1\\\/p62, whereas NFE2L2 did not bind to ACTB or to a region of NQO1 that does not contain any ARE (NQO1*). Interestingly, NFE2L2 bound to ARE1 and ARE2 in LAMP2 but not to ARE3 ( and Table S3).\\n\\nWe next analyzed the functionality of these putative AREs. Three tandem nucleotide sequences of each ARE or a control scramble sequence were cloned in the promoter region of a luciferase reporter as shown in . Nfe2l2-deficient cells were transiently co-transfected with these constructs and increasing amounts of NFE2L2-\\u0394ETGE-V5. We found that NFE2L2 expression induced luciferase expression in reporters carrying ARE1 and ARE2 but not ARE3 or the scramble negative control (). As an additional control, change of a highly conserved G to A in the putative ARE1 and ARE2 sequences greatly reduced luciferase expression (Figure S1). Altogether, these results indicate that NFE2L2 binds and activates, at least, 2 AREs in the LAMP2 gene, termed here ARE1 and ARE2.\\n\\nLAMP2A levels are regulated by NFE2L2To determine if, in fact, NFE2L2\\u00a0has an impact on LAMP2A expression, HEK293T cells were infected with a lentiviral vector expressing GFP as negative control or NFE2L2 \\u0394ETGE-V5. As shown in -, NFE2L2 overexpression led to a modest but consistent increase in LAMP2A levels as well as in the positive controls HMOX1 and SQSTM1. In addition, we used a knockdown strategy to reduce NFE2L2 activity in the lung carcinoma cell line A549, which lacks KEAP1 and therefore exhibits high NFE2L2 protein levels. NFE2L2 knockdown reduced mRNA and protein levels of HMOX1, SQSTM1 and also LAMP2A (-).10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-F0002Figure 2.LAMP2A levels are modified upon genetic manipulation of NFE2L2.

Messenger RNA and protein levels of HMOX1, SQSTM1 and LAMP2A were lower in nfe2l2-knockout (nfe2l2-KO) than in Nfe2l2-wild type (Nfe2l2-WT) cells (, c and ). Moreover, lentivirus-induced overexpression of NFE2L2\\u0394ETGE-V5 partially rescued the mRNA expression of these 3 genes in nfe2l2-KO hepatocytes (). Lamp2b and Lamp2c isoforms were not significantly changed upon overexpression or knockdown of NFE2L2 (Fig. S2), in agreement with the reported regulation- and cell-specific expression of these 2 isoforms, which do not participate in CMA. Moreover, reduction of LAMP2A\\\/Lamp2a levels in the absence of NFE2L2 was also confirmed in human astrocytes, mouse hippocampal cells, embryo fibroblasts and cortical neurons from Nfe2l2-WT vs nfe2l2-KO mice (Fig. S3).10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-F0003Figure 3.LAMP2A levels are reduced in the absence of NFE2L2.

We also analyzed LAMP2A levels in lysosomes by immunofluorescence and, as shown in  and , the overall intensity and the number of puncta per cell of LAMP2A (red), which colocalized with LAMP1 (green), were dramatically reduced in nfe2l2-KO hepatocytes compared with Nfe2l2-WT hepatocytes. Altogether, NFE2L2 absence results in parallel changes in mRNA and protein levels of LAMP2A, especially in the lysosomal fraction.\\n\\nNFE2L2 controls CMA under oxidant conditionsWe characterized the redox status of immortalized hepatocytes derived from Nfe2l2-WT or nfe2l2-KO mice. As shown in  and , dihydroethidium (DHE) staining did not reflect major differences in ROS levels between these cell types under basal conditions. However, upon treatment for 16\\u00a0h with the oxidative stress-inducing drug paraquat (PQ), nfe2l2-KO hepatocytes exhibited increased DHE fluorescence compared to Nfe2l2-WT cells. As NFE2L2 controls the production of the universal reducing agent NADPH, we analyzed the ratio between oxidized NADP and reduced NADPH in these cells. nfe2l2-KO hepatocytes showed an augmented NADP+:NADPH ratio, which may be sufficient to handle ROS under basal conditions but not in the presence of oxidants such as PQ (). Importantly, despite having higher ROS levels, nfe2l2-KO hepatocytes failed to increase LAMP2A levels upon PQ exposure ( and ). Similar results were also observed with hydrogen peroxide (Fig. S4A and S4B).10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-F0004Figure 4.The oxidant agent paraquat (PQ) induces LAMP2A expression and CMA activity in an NFE2L2-dependent manner.

[]). Upon 405\\u00a0nm light exposure, Dendra protein is modified to emit red fluorescence, making it possible to track its delivery to lysosomes over newly synthesized protein. CMA activity is detected as a change from diffuse (cytosolic) fluorescence to a punctate (lysosomal) pattern, because CMA-active lysosomes are highlighted as red fluorescent puncta when the fluorescence substrate is delivered to this compartment. As shown in f and , Nfe2l2-WT cells exhibited a low cytosolic signal and some Dendra-positive fluorescent puncta, reflecting basal CMA activity. However, a more intense and diffuse fluorescent pattern throughout the cytoplasm, together with an extremely reduced number of Dendra-positive puncta per cell, were observed in nfe2l2-KO cells, consistent with impaired basal CMA activity (the KFERQ-PS-Dendra reporter is not being properly degraded by CMA and accumulates in the cytosol). When cells were treated for 16\\u00a0h with PQ, a well-characterized stimulus for CMA [], we found a significant increase in Dendra-positive puncta per cell in Nfe2l2-WT but not nfe2l2-KO hepatocytes, indicating impaired induction of CMA by PQ in the absence of NFE2L2 ( and ).\\n\\nPharmacological activation of NFE2L2 induces LAMP2A expression and CMAWe next used a well-established activator of NFE2L2, sulforaphane (SFN), to test if pharmacological activation of NFE2L2 could lead to upregulation of LAMP2A levels and CMA activity. Treatment of Nfe2l2-WT hepatocytes with increasing doses of SFN for 16\\u00a0h led to increased protein levels of NFE2L2, HMOX1, SQSTM1 and also LAMP2A, and this response was abolished in nfe2l2-KO cells ( and ). Similar results were obtained with the NFE2L2 activator dimethyl fumarate (Fig. S4C and S4D). We further extended these observations to other cell types such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts, N2A neuroblastoma cells, mouse hippocampus-derived HT22 and human kidney HEK293T cells, hence corroborating again the conservation of this NFE2L2-LAMP2A axis among different cell types (Fig. S5A and S5B). Moreover, SFN-treated cells displayed mobilization of lysosomes (labeled either with LAMP2A or LAMP1) toward the perinuclear region, a typical characteristic of CMA activation []. Perinuclear LAMP2A fluorescence was much lower in nfe2l2-KO hepatocytes ( and ).10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-F0005Figure 5.Pharmacological activation of NFE2L2 induces LAMP2A levels and CMA activation.

Statistical analysis was performed using Student t test. **p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.01 and ***p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.001 vs. untreated conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, to directly confirm CMA activation, we transduced cells with the KFERQ-PS-Dendra reporter. Compared to untreated cells, SFN induced a significant dose-dependent increase in Dendra-positive puncta per cell in Nfe2l2-WT cells (note that because perinuclear relocation made individual puncta indiscernible, data are presented as punctate KFERQ-Dendra positive area per cell) ( and ). By contrast, SFN treatment failed to upregulate CMA in the absence of NFE2L2. Previous studies have shown compensatory cross-talk between CMA and macroautophagy. Because we have shown before that NFE2L2 also exerts a modulatory effect on macroautophagy, we next set out to investigate if CMA activation upon SFN treatment was primary or reactive to changes in macroautophagy. In macroautophagy-deficient atg5-KO cells (Fig. S5C-F) we found that SFN was still able to induce the expression of LAMP2A and subsequent increase in CMA activity. These findings indicate that the regulation of CMA by NFE2L2 is, for the most part, independent of changes in macroautophagy activity.\\n\\nImpaired CMA in lysosomes from livers of nfe2l2-KO miceTo analyze the functional role of NFE2L2 in the modulation of CMA in vivo, we used livers of Nfe2l2-WT and nfe2l2-KO mice. Consistent with our in vitro results with cultured hepatocytes, mRNA levels of Hmox1, Sqstm1 and Lamp2a were reduced in livers from nfe2l2-KO mice (). Analysis of lysosomes isolated from these livers revealed a discrete decrease in LAMP2A levels in the nfe2l2-KO group ( and ). The discrete differences in lysosomal LAMP2A levels are likely due to an overall increase in the ratio between lysosomal components and cargo in the nfe2l2-KO mice because of their lower CMA activity. In fact, contrary to the decrease in LAMP2A, levels of other lysosomal resident proteins such as HSPA8 and GBA were relatively higher in the lysosomes of nfe2l2-KO mice ( and ).10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-F0006Figure 6.Role of NFE2L2 in the modulation of CMA in vivo.

The amount of RNASE recovered in untreated lysosomes represents the fraction bound at the lysosomal membrane, because the protein internalized during the incubation is rapidly degraded. Pretreatment with PI allows recovering lysosomes with both the RNASE bound and internalized. Thus, uptake was calculated as the difference in RNASE levels between non-treated and PI-treated conditions. As shown in  and , lysosomes from nfe2l2-KO mice showed a trend toward reduced RNASE uptake in comparison with Nfe2l2-WT littermates, although it did not reach statistical significance. We confirmed that the observed differences were not due to loss of lysosomal membrane integrity (Fig. S6A) or reduced proteolytic activity, which was in fact higher in the absence of NFE2L2 (Fig. S6B).\\n\\nTo gain further insight into the role of NFE2L2 in the modulation of CMA in vivo we directly measured the degradation of the endogenous CMA substrate GAPDH in lysosomes from Nfe2l2-WT and nfe2l2-KO mice. Mice were starved for 24\\u00a0h to maximally induce CMA, and then injected intraperitoneally with vehicle or leupeptin to block proteolysis inside lysosomes. Because LAMP2A and LAMP1 levels may oscillate with leupeptin due to changes in the ratio between cargo and lysosomal components, in this case we normalized lysosomal GAPDH with total lysosomal protein as stained with Ponceau Red. As shown in  and , GAPDH accumulated in lysosomes from leupeptin-treated Nfe2l2-WT mice but not nfe2l2-KO mice, although these animals exhibited higher basal levels of lysosomal GAPDH. These results suggest that NFE2L2 deficiency impairs basal CMA at the level of substrate internalization.\\n\\nDiscussionIn this study, we report a molecular link between the transcription factor NFE2L2 and CMA, which occurs through the control of LAMP2A transcription. Knockout of Lamp2a or Nfe2l2 makes cells more susceptible to different stressors [,], indicating a crucial role in the maintenance of cell homeostasis under different circumstances. In fact, previous work supports the notion that redox status tightly controls CMA activity, presumably to eliminate proteins oxidized during mild oxidative damage []. Interestingly, CMA induction upon oxidative stress appears to occur through increased Lamp2a transcription [], whereas CMA activation by nutrient deprivation relies on diminished degradation of LAMP2A and relocation of this receptor at the lysosomal membrane [], pointing to the existence of several mechanisms of CMA regulation.\\n\\nSeveral transcription factors might regulate LAMP2 expression. AP-1 and SP1 binding sites were found in the LAMP2 promoter [], although they were not confirmed to be functional enhancers. MAF proteins, the other bZIP partner of the NFE2L2\\u00a0heterodimer, heterodimerize also with NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), which upon activation modulates Lamp2a transcription in T lymphocytes []. We have identified 2 functional AREs in the LAMP2 gene that lose activity when a highly conserved G is replaced to A. This is the binding site for MAF [] and consequently we suggest that MAFs participate in a dual regulation of LAMP2 by both NFAT and NFE2L2. Of note, NFE2L2 would control not only inducible but also Lamp2a basal expression, as Nfe2l2-deficient cells exhibited reduced Lamp2a mRNA and protein levels. It is thus possible that different transcription factors co-exist to assure proteostasis under several circumstances and in distinct cell types. In fact, levels of basal CMA activity and the amplitude of the induction varies among different cell types [,,,]. Importantly, this novel NFE2L2-LAMP2A axis is conserved in different cell types.\\n\\nDespite being encoded by the same gene, different transmembrane and cytosolic regions in each LAMP2 spliced variant enable specific functions. In fact, several roles have been proposed for LAMP2B and LAMP2C [,\\u2013], but LAMP2A is the only isoform required for CMA [,,]. LAMP2 isoforms display tissue-specific expression patterns [,]. While LAMP2A and LAMP2B are highly expressed in most tissues, LAMP2C appears to be very restricted [], pointing to a different splicing regulation of the LAMP2 gene. Although we could not detect differences in the expression levels of LAMP2B or LAMP2C upon genetic manipulation of NFE2L2 in human HEK293T cells, mouse hepatocytes or HT22 cells, reduced levels of LAMP2B mRNA were found in A549 cells upon NFE2L2 silencing, and NFE2L2-deficient MEFs displayed reduced levels of the 3 isoforms. Differential regulation of the 3 isoforms has been reported previously [,,]. For example, paraquat transcriptionally induces Lamp2a expression without affecting the other 2 isoforms []. Altogether, these data suggest the existence of additional post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of the Lamp2 gene that need to be unveiled in future studies.\\n\\nChemical and genetic manipulation of NFE2L2 results in modest changes in cellular LAMP2A mRNA and protein levels, albeit similar to those observed for the NFE2L2-responsive SQSTM1 gene. LAMP2A has a slow turnover, with a half-life of approximately 46\\u00a0h for total LAMP2A and 57\\u00a0h for lysosomal LAMP2A []. Hence, small changes in LAMP2A mRNA levels may have a marked impact on protein levels and CMA activity. Other studies show similar oscillations, further supporting this notion [,,,]. In contrast with the discrete changes in total cellular LAMP2A levels, the effects of NFE2L2-deficiency are more dramatic in isolated lysosomes, where LAMP2A is required for CMA. In fact, it has been extensively shown before that levels of LAMP2A at the lysosomal membrane are the ones correlating with changes in the rate of CMA []. As a result, CMA was barely detectable in NFE2L2-deficient hepatocytes, suggesting a crucial role for NFE2L2 in modulation of CMA.\\n\\nWhile we have described the transcriptional regulation of Lamp2a by NFE2L2, other layers of CMA regulation are still possible. For example, lysosomes from nfe2l2-KO livers exhibited higher levels of HSPA8 compared to Nfe2l2-WT livers. Although it is possible that higher levels of HSPA8 are a result of the relative decrease in lysosomal cargoes, we cannot discard the possibility that the increase in lysosomal HSPA8 may represent a compensatory mechanism to counteract the decrease in LAMP2A levels. In fact, increased HSPA8 levels have been previously reported in other conditions with reduced lysosomal levels of LAMP2A, such as livers from old mice and in lamp2a-KO mice [,].\\n\\nThe impairment of CMA in nfe2l2-KO mice was evidenced by a deficient uptake in the in vitro reconstituted system of RNASE but more importantly by the reduced degradation in vivo of the endogenous bona fide CMA substrate GAPDH. The fact that the differences in uptake in vivo of the endogenous substrate are more pronounced than for the exogenously added protein in the isolated in vitro system could be attributed to the lack of other competing substrates in the latter. Interestingly, a previous report showed that astrocyte-specific NFE2L2 overexpression reduced the levels of another CMA substrate, MEF2D (myocyte enhancer factor 2D) []. However, this study was just correlative and ours is the first one to show that changes in CMA substrates are at the level of lysosomal degradation by CMA.\\n\\nNFE2L2 has been reported to transcriptionally regulate macroautophagy []. Crosstalk between both autophagic pathways has been extensively reported both in vivo and in vitro, whereby one reacts in a compensatory manner to the loss of activity in the other [,,]. However, in this work we show that the functional connection between NFE2L2 and CMA is independent of macroautophagy. Therefore, NFE2L2 might act as a regulatory node in the proteolytic network represented by macroautophagy and CMA.\\n\\nBoth CMA [,] and NFE2L2 [,] activities decline with age, probably favoring the accumulation of oxidized substrates. A wide variety of NFE2L2 inducers have been reported, and in fact, in this study we successfully used SFN to increase Lamp2a mRNA and protein levels and increase CMA activity. Considering the positive effect that genetic restoration of CMA had in proteostasis of the livers of old mice [], it is reasonable to think that the pharmacological reinforcement of NFE2L2 and consequently CMA would be capable of a similar delay in the accumulation of oxidized protein aggregates during aging.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsCell culture and reagentsAdenocarcinoma human alveolar A549 cells and human embryonic kidney HEK293T cells (ATCC, CCL-185 and CRL-3216, respectively) were grown in Dulbecco\\u2019s modified Eagle\\u2019s medium (Sigma-Aldrich, D5648) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, CH30160.03) and 80 \\u03bcg\\\/ml gentamicin (Laboratorios Normon, 763,011.1). Immortalized mouse hepatocytes were grown in the same medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2\\u00a0mM glutamine (Gibco\\\/Life Technologies, 25,030\\u2013024), 1\\u00a0mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco\\\/Life Technologies, 11,360\\u2013039), 5\\u00a0mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.5\\u2009U\\\/ml penicillin, 0.5\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/ml streptomycin (Gibco\\\/Life Technologies, 15,140\\u2013122). Other reagents include: Dihidroethiudium (Invitrogen, D11347). R,S-sulforaphane (SFN; LKT Laboratories, Inc., S8044). Sucrose (Panreac, 131,621). Leupeptin hemisulfate salt (>\\u00a095%; L5793) and paraquat (M2254) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Transient transfections were performed with GenJET\\u2122 In Vitro Transfection Reagent from SignaGen (SL100488).\\n\\nBioinformatics analysisPutative AREs in the LAMP2 gene were identified in ENCODE [] for the human genome taking as reference the available information from ChIP of ARE binding factors MAFK, MAFF and BACH1. The putative MAFK, MAFF and BACH1 binding regions were localized in 200\\u2013400 base-pair-long DNase-sensitive and H3K27Ac-rich regions. In addition, a frequency matrix of the consensus ARE sequence based on the JASPAR database [] was converted to a position-specific scoring matrix and a script was generated with the Python 3.4 program to scan the promoter sequences with candidate AREs as previously described [].\\n\\nChromatin immunoprecipitation (chip) assaysHEK293T cells were grown on 10-cm plates until they reached 85% confluence and transfected with an NFE2L2 expression plasmid that lacks the high affinity binding site for KEAP1 and contains a V5 tag (NFE2L2\\u0394ETGE-V5) []. Briefly, cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (Fluka, 47,630) and the reaction was stopped with 125\\u00a0mM glycine (Bio-Rad, 161\\u20130718). Cells were then washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 10\\u00a0mM PO43\\u2212, 137\\u00a0mM NaCl, 2.7\\u00a0mM KCl, pH 7.4), lysed and sonicated in order to obtain adequate fragment sizes of DNA. Supernatant was diluted 10 fold with ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate [Merck Millipore, 817,034], 1.1% Triton X-100 [Sigma-Aldrich, T8787], 1.2\\u00a0mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 16.7\\u00a0mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 167\\u00a0mM NaCl, 1\\u00a0mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [Sigma-Aldrich, P7626], 1\\u00a0\\u00b5g\\\/ml leupeptin [Sigma-Aldrich, L5793]) and pre-cleared with protein G Sepharose (GE Healthcare, 17\\u20130618-01). ChIP was carried out with anti-V5 antibody (Life Technologies, 37\\u20137500) or anti-IgG (Abcam, ab18413). DNA was eluted and purified, analyzing the presence of previously identified putative AREs by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) with specific primers (Table S2). Samples from at least 3 independent immunoprecipitations were analyzed.\\n\\nLuciferase reporter generationArtificial oligonucleotides with 3 tandem repetitions of the putative AREs identified separated with a BamHI sequence and a random separating-sequence, as well as the scramble sequence used as negative control, are described in Table S4. These oligonucleotides were subcloned into NheI and XhoI sites of the minimal Sod1 promoter pGL3basic-sod1-29 [], removing the NheI site to facilitate religated vector exclusion. Scramble-LUC included also a SalI site instead of the separating-sequence to facilitate differentiation between the constructs.\\n\\nLuciferase activityTransient transfections of nfe2l2-KO cells were performed with the expression vectors ARE-LUC or SCRAMBLE-LUC as indicated. pTK-Renilla was used as an internal control vector. Luciferase assays were performed with the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega, E1910) as described previously [].\\n\\nProduction of lentiviral stocks and infectionRecombinant lentiviral stocks were produced in HEK293T\\\/17 cells by co-transfecting 10 \\u03bcg of transfer vector (GFP or NFE2L2\\u0394EGTE-V5), 6 \\u03bcg of envelope plasmid pMD2.G (Addgene, 12,259; deposited by Didier Trono) and 6 \\u03bcg of packaging plasmid pSPAX2 (Addgene, 12,260; deposited by Didier Trono), using Lipofectamine\\u00ae 2000 Reagent (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, 116,668\\u2013019). After 12\\u00a0h at 37\\u00b0C the medium was replaced with fresh Dulbecco\\u2019s modified Eagle\\u2019s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and virus particles were harvested at 24\\u00a0h and 48\\u00a0h post-transfection. Cells were incubated in the presence of 2\\u00a0\\u00b5g\\\/ml polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich, TR-1003-G) with the lentivirus during 24\\u00a0h and mRNA was extracted 3\\u00a0days after lentiviral transduction. Lentivirus carrying the KFERQ-PS-Dendra reporter were prepared as described previously [] and added to hepatocytes in the presence of 2\\u00a0\\u00b5g\\\/ml polybrene 24\\u00a0h before the beginning of the CMA measurement.\\n\\nAnalysis of mrna levelsTotal RNA extraction, reverse transcription and quantitative PCR were carried out as detailed elsewhere []. Primer sequences are shown in Tables S5 and S6. To ensure that equal amounts of cDNA were added to the PCR, the housekeeping genes Actb and Tbp were amplified. Data analysis was based on the \\u0394\\u0394CT method with normalization of the raw data to housekeeping genes (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). All PCRs were performed at least in triplicate.\\n\\nImmunoblottingImmunoblots were performed as described elsewhere []. The primary antibodies used are presented in . Membranes were analyzed using the appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, A15999; Amersham, NA931 and NA934; Merck Millipore, AP136P). Proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (GE Healthcare, RPN2232).10.1080\\\/15548627.2018.1474992-T0002Table 2.Antibodies used in immunoblots, immunofluorescence and ChIP.\\n\\nAntibodySourceCatalog numberDilutionNFE2L2\\\/NRF2Cuadrado lab-1:2000 (WB)HMOX1Enzo Life SciencesOSA1101:2000 (WB)SQSTM1\\\/p62Sigma AldrichP00671:2000 (WB)MmLAMP2A\\\/Igp96Zymed\\\/Invitrogen51\\u201322001:1000 (WB). 1:100 (ICF)HsLAMP2AAbcamab185281:1000 (WB)LAMP2BCuervo lab-1:1000 (WB)LAMP2CCuervo lab-1:1000 (WB)LAMP1 (1D4B)Hybridoma Bank1D4B1:1000 (WB). 1:250 (ICF)RNASERockland Immunochemicals100\\u20131881:5000 (WB)HSPA8\\\/HSC70 (13D3)Novus BiologicalsNB12027881:5000 (WB)ACTBSanta Cruz Biotechnologysc-16161:5000 (WB)LMNB\\\/lamin BSanta Cruz Biotechnologysc-62171:5000 (WB)GAPDHCalbiochemCB10011:5000 (WB)LC3BCell Signaling Technology27751:2000 (WB)V5Life Technologies37\\u201375001:250 (ChIP)IgG2aAbcamab184131:250 (ChIP)ICF, immunocytofluorescence.

Food and water were provided ad libitum and mice were cared for according to protocols approved by the Ethics Committee for Research of the Universidad Aut\\u00f3noma de Madrid following institutional, Spanish and European guidelines (Bolet\\u00edn Oficial del Estado of 18 March 1988; and 86\\\/609\\\/EEC, 2003\\\/65\\\/EC European Council Directives). Where indicated, food was removed for 24\\u00a0h but water was still provided ad libitum. Where stated, mice received intraperitoneal injections of vehicle (0.9% saline buffer) or leupeptin (2\\u00a0mg\\\/100\\u00a0g body weight) 16\\u00a0h and 2 h before sacrifice.\\n\\nLysosomal isolationFor in vivo analysis, lysosomal-enriched fractions or CMA-active lysosomes from Nfe2l2-WT and nfe2l2-KO mouse livers were obtained as previously described []. Briefly, livers were mechanically homogenized in 0.25\\u00a0M sucrose, filtered through double gauze and centrifuged at 6800\\u00a0g. The supernatant was then centrifuged at 17,000\\u00a0g and the pellet was resuspended with a \\u2018cold finger\\u2019 (dry glass test tube filled with ice). This step was repeated twice to wash the lysosomal-enriched fraction. Lysosomes active for CMA were isolated by centrifugation of the lysosomal-enriched fraction (light mitochondria and lysosomes) in a discontinuous metrizamide (AK Scientific, 69,696) density gradient [,]. The fraction of broken lysosomes at the moment of isolation was measured using the HEX\\\/\\u03b2-hexosaminidase latency assay []. In some experiments, a crude lysosomal fraction was prepared from hepatocytes derived from wild-type and nfe2l2-KO mice using the Lysosome Isolation Kit from BioVision (K235-50) according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions.\\n\\nImmunocytofluorescenceHepatocytes were seeded on sterile cover slips in 24-well plates (75,000 cells per well), cultured for 16\\u00a0h and treated as indicated. Cells were washed with cold PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15\\u00a0min at room temperature. After 3 5-min washes with PBS, cells were incubated with blocking solution (0.2% powdered milk, 2% normal goat serum [Merck Millipore, NS20L], 0.1M glycine, 1% bovine serum albumin [Sigma-Aldrich, A7906] and 0.01% Triton X-100) for 30\\u00a0min at room temperature. After briefly washing twice with PBS, the slides were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies () for 90\\u00a0min at room temperature in a humidified chamber. Then cells were washed 3 times with PBS and incubated with secondary antibodies for 45\\u00a0min under the same conditions. To visualize the nuclei, cells were stained with DAPI (4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The fluorescence images were captured using appropriate filters in a Leica DMIRE2TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Nussloch, Germany).\\n\\nMeasurement of CMA activity in intact cellsTo measure CMA activity in intact cells the photoswitchable KFERQ-PSDendra2 reporter was transduced into cells using lentiviral delivery []. Cells were photoactivated with a 405-nm light-emitting diode (LED: Norlux) for 4\\u00a0min with the intensity of 3.5\\u00a0mA (current constant). After 16\\u00a0h, cells were fixed and slides prepared using mounting medium containing DAPI (Abcam, ab104139) to highlight the cell nucleus. All images were acquired with an Axiovert 200 fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss Microscopy) with a 100x objective and 1.4 numerical aperture, mounted with an ApoTome.2 slider. Quantification was performed in individual frames after deconvolution and thresholding using ImageJ software (NIH) in a minimum of 20 cells per slide. In all cases, focal plane thickness was set at 0.17 \\u03bcm and sections with maximal nucleus diameter were selected for quantification. Values are presented as number of puncta per cell section that in our acquisition conditions represents 10\\u201320% of the total puncta per cell. CMA activation was detected as changes in the fluorescence pattern from diffuse\\\/cytosolic to punctate\\\/lysosomal and quantified as the average number of fluorescent puncta per cell or as the cellular area positive for KFERQ-Dendra puncta []. Where indicated, high-content microscopy was used instead to better determine dose-dependence effects in a larger number of cells. Briefly, cells were plated in glass-bottom 96-well plates, treated for the indicated times and, after fixation, images were acquired using a high-content microscope (Operetta, Perkin Elmer). Images of 9 different fields per well were captured, resulting in an average of 2,500\\u20133,000 cells per condition. Nuclei and puncta were identified using the manufacturer\\u2019s software. The number of particles\\\/puncta per cell was quantified using the \\u2018particle identifier\\u2019 function in the cytosolic region after thresholding in non-saturated images [].\\n\\nMeasurement of CMA in vitroCMA activity in vitro was measured using isolated intact lysosomes incubated with purified proteins and subjected to immunoblot [,]. Binding was calculated as the amount of substrate protein bound to the lysosomal membrane in the absence of protease inhibitors, and uptake by subtracting the amount of protein associated with lysosomes in the presence (protein bound to the lysosomal membrane and taken up by lysosomes) and absence (protein bound to the lysosomal membrane) of protease inhibitors []. Proteolytic activity was determined by incubating lysosomes with a cocktail of long-lived radiolabeled proteins (3H-pool) previously demonstrated to be enriched in CMA substrates [,] in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100 to disrupt the lysosomal membrane. Samples were incubated in 20\\u00a0mM MOPS, 1\\u00a0mM DTT, 5.4\\u00a0\\u00b5M cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich, 168,149), pH 7.3, 0.25\\u00a0M sucrose (Sigma-Aldrich, S0389) for 20\\u00a0min at 37\\u00baC. At the end of the incubation, 10% TCA was added to all the samples and they were subjected to filtration through a 0.2 \\u03bcm filter, as previously described. Proteolysis was calculated as the percentage of acid precipitable radioactivity (protein) at the begging of the incubation that became acid soluble (amino acids) at the end of the incubation [].\\n\\nImage analysisDifferent band intensities corresponding to immunoblot detection of protein samples were quantified using ImageJ software. The number of puncta per cell was analyzed with the \\u2018Analyze particles\\u2019 function of ImageJ after thresholding in non-saturated images []. DHE fluorescence intensity was quantified with ImageJ and is presented as the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF; CTCF\\u00a0=\\u00a0integrated density \\u2013 [area of selected cell x mean fluorescence of background readings]). Perinuclear LAMP2A fluorescence was measured with the \\u2018Radial profile angle\\u2019 plugin of ImageJ after properly calibrating the image. A circular mask with a radius of 100 pixels (25\\u00a0\\u00b5m, approximately) was used to analyze fluorescence intensity per cell. For each cell, the algorithm measured the mean signal intensity in a series of concentric circles drawn along the established radius, starting from the nucleus and towards the cell periphery. Quantifications were performed in 50\\u201375 cells per condition in 3 independent experiments.\\n\\nStatistical analysisUnless otherwise indicated, all experiments were performed at least 3 times and all data presented in the graphs are the mean of at least 3 independent samples \\u00b1\\u00a0standard error (SD). Student\\u2019s t-test was used to assess differences between groups. p\\u00a0<\\u00a00.05 was considered significant.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of

The molecular mechanisms that connect air pollution with brain pathology are largely unknown but seem to depend on the chemical composition of airborne particulate matter (PM). We sourced ambient PM from Riverside, California, and selectively exposed rats to coarse (PM 2.5-10 : 2.5-10\\u2009\\u00b5m), fine (PM <2.5 : <2.5\\u2009\\u00b5m), or ultrafine particles (UFPM: <0.15\\u2009\\u00b5m). We characterized each PM type via atomic emission spectroscopy and detected nickel, cobalt and zinc within them. We then exposed rats separately to each PM type for short (2 weeks), intermediate (1-3 months) and long durations (1 year). All three metals accumulated in rat brains during intermediate-length PM exposures. Via RNAseq analysis we then determined that intermediate-length PM 2.5-10  exposures triggered the expression of the early growth response gene 2 (EGR2), genes encoding inflammatory cytokine pathways (IL13-R\\u03b11 and IL-16) and the oncogene RAC1. Gene upregulation occurred only in brains of rats exposed to PM 2.5-10  and correlated with cerebral nickel accumulation. We hypothesize that the expression of inflammation and oncogenesis-related genes is triggered by the combinatorial exposure to certain metals and toxins in Los Angeles Basin PM 2.5-10 .\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionAir pollution leads to well-documented cardiovascular and respiratory problems,, brain cancer,\\u00a0and neurological disorders including strokes, Alzheimer\\u2019s, and Parkinson\\u2019s disease\\u2013. To better understand the biological mechanisms that underlie pollution-associated brain disorders, we must identify disease causing components in air pollution mixtures; these include gases, particulate matter (PM), trace metals, and organic compounds. We focus on the synergistic interplay between PM, trace metals and toxins in Los Angeles Basin ambient air pollution.\\n\\nIn humans, exposures to high levels of air pollution are associated with chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration,. Brain tissue samples from individuals residing in Mexico City contained increased numbers of infiltrating monocytes, activated microglia, increased expression of interleukin 1 beta, blood-brain barrier (BBB) damage, endothelial cell activation and prefrontal cortical lesions,. Moreover, increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers, deposits of alpha-synuclein, amyloid beta protein and hyper-phosphorylated tau protein, collectively indicative of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, have been documented in brains from urban residents,\\u2013.\\n\\nAnimals show similar responses to air pollution. Mexico City stray dogs had elevated concentrations of vanadium and nickel in cortical and olfactory bulb neurons. Amyloid beta protein depositions were also detected. Experimentally, it has been shown that prolonged exposures to diesel exhaust cause neuroinflammation in rats, while nanoscale PM from Los Angeles urban traffic induced oxidative stress and inflammation in the olfactory epithelium and the brain. Exposure to vehicle exhaust also increases anxiety and depression-like behaviors in rats, and accelerates plaque formation in a mouse model of Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\\n\\nIn the present study, airborne PM were defined as either coarse (PM2.5\\u201310: 2.5\\u201310\\u2009\\u03bcm), fine (PM<2.5: <2.5\\u2009\\u03bcm) or ultrafine particulate matter (UFPM: <0.25\\u2009\\u03bcm). PM<2.5 also contained UFPM. Each type of PM has a distinct composition and mediates different effects on organ health. UFPM deposit deep in the lungs and are small enough to cross epithelial barriers into the circulation. From there, UFPM can impact distal organs, including the heart and brain, and enter intracellular compartments to disrupt normal cell function,. Coarse PM, on the other hand, deposit via inertial impactation in the upper respiratory system and may be partially removed via mucociliary clearance or ingestion\\\/sequestration in lymphoid and intestinal tissues. Coarse particles probably do not enter the circulatory system directly, but trace metals, endotoxins and other soluble compounds present on coarse PM can leach into the fluid lining of the airways. Leached metals trigger the production of reactive oxygen species via Fenton-like reactions and soluble toxins can activate molecular signaling cascades that trigger tissue inflammation. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, monocytes and macrophages are subsequently released into the systemic circulation, and if sustained, can trigger BBB damage,, nervous system inflammation and the expression of cancer-related genes in brain tissue. Many studies that have investigated PM effects on organ health defined PM10, as per regulation, as any particulate matter sized \\u226410\\u2009\\u03bcm. PM10 therefore also contains PM<2.5 and UFPM. To better understand how individual PM types affect our health, it is instructive to separate the coarse and fine particles. We used a material impactor to separate coarse from fine PM and then fractionated the fine PM into PM<2.5 and UFPM aerosols. Therefore, PM2.5\\u201310 in our study contains only 2.5\\u201310\\u2009\\u03bcm sized particles.\\n\\nBelow we describe our observations on the association between toxic metals found in different PM types with the expression of inflammation and oncogenes in rat brains. Atomic emission spectroscopy was first used to analyze the metal contents of PM2.5\\u201310, PM<2.5 and UFPM in ambient air from the Los Angeles Basin. We then exposed rats for short (2 weeks), intermediate (1\\u20133 months) and long (1 year) time periods separately to each PM type. We demonstrate that intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 and UFPM lead to cerebral metal accumulation. However, upregulation of inflammation and tumorigenesis biomarkers was only observed following exposures to PM2.5\\u201310, not UFPM. We explain this finding by comparing the unique toxicological profiles of PM2.5\\u201310 and UFPM; both contain metals, but only PM2.5\\u201310 specifically correlates with ambient endotoxin concentrations in Southern California,. This suggests that combinatorial exposures to multiple toxins are necessary to trigger certain molecular events that precede inflammation and tumorigenesis.\\n\\nResultsWe exposed rats separately to either PM2.5\\u201310, PM<2.5, UFPM or filtered air. Via inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES), we first analyzed the metal content of our PM samples and then asked if these metals accumulated in the brains of rats that were exposed to PM.\\n\\nSix metals, namely cadmium, cobalt, lead, nickel, vanadium, and zinc, were detected via ICP-AES in our PM samples. Only nickel (Ni), cobalt (Co), lead, and zinc (Zn) were identifiable in all types of PM (Table\\u00a0). The Ni content ranged from 0.0025 to 0.012\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3, the Co content from 0.0016 to 0.0037\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3, the lead content from 0.0023 to 0.034\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3, and the Zn content from 0.042 to 0.265\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/m3 (Table\\u00a0). Zn was thus the most prevalent metal in our PM samples.Table 1Metal content in PM polluted air in \\u03bcg\\\/m3.\\n\\nElementPM2.5\\u201310(\\u03bcg\\\/m3\\\/PM)PM<2.5(\\u03bcg\\\/m3\\\/PM)UFPM(\\u03bcg\\\/m3\\\/PM)Antimonyn.d.n.d.n.d.Arsenicn.d.n.d.n.d.\\nCadmium\\nn.d.\\n0.0022\\n\\n0.0011\\n\\nCobalt\\n\\n0.0026\\n\\n0.0037\\n\\n0.0016\\n\\nLead\\n\\n0.0023\\n\\n0.0343\\n\\n0.011\\n\\nNickel\\n\\n0.0025\\n\\n0.012\\n\\n0.0053\\nPalladiumn.d.n.d.n.d.Platinumn.d.n.d.n.d.Rhodiumn.d.n.d.n.d.\\nVanadium\\nn.d.\\n0.0016\\n\\n0.0025\\n\\nZinc\\n\\n0.042\\n\\n0.2650\\n\\n0.078\\nHeavy metal concentrations in PM sourced from Riverside, California.

The abbreviation n.d. indicates no detection.\\n\\n\\n\\nRats in all experimental groups, including those exposed to filtered air, had detectable levels of Ni, Co and Zn in their brains (Fig.\\u00a0). The Ni content remained approximately constant over 12 months (Fig.\\u00a0), but the Co content increased significantly after 12 months of exposures to filtered air (Fig.\\u00a0; ANOVA: F(2,9)\\u2009=\\u200932.35, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). The Zn content was approximately 1000-fold higher than that of Co and Ni, but showed a significant decrease after 12 months of exposures to filtered air (Fig.\\u00a0; ANOVA: F(2, 7)\\u2009=\\u200968.52, p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). These results demonstrate that a certain amount of heavy metal accumulation (Co) and clearance (Zn) occurs in the absence of targeted PM exposures. We next compare metal contents in the brains of rats exposed to concentrated ambient PM vs. filtered air.Figure 1Metal content in rat brains after exposures to filtered air. Levels of (A) nickel were approximately stable, while (B) cobalt accumulated, and (C) zinc dissipated. Data are shown as mean\\u2009+\\u2009S.E.M. Statistical significance is indicated as p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 (*), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 (**) and p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001 (***).\\n\\n\\n\\nSignificant accumulation of Ni, Co and Zn after 1 month of PM exposuresExposing rats to PM2.5\\u201310, PM<2.5 or UFPM for 2 weeks did not cause significant accumulations of metals in their brains (see Fig.\\u00a0 short exposures). However, intermediate length exposures of 1\\u20133 months, led to significant increases of cerebral metal contents in comparison to specimens from filtered air control groups (ANOVANi: F(3, 23)\\u2009=\\u200910.04, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0002; ANOVACo: F(3, 31)\\u2009=\\u20095.93, p\\u2009=\\u20090.002; ANOVAZn: F(3, 28)\\u2009=\\u20092.75, p\\u2009=\\u20090.06). Cerebral Ni levels were increased after exposures to UFPM (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and PM2.5\\u201310 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.011, both Dunnett t-test; see Fig.\\u00a0). Cerebral Co accumulation was similarly increased after exposures to UFPM (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and PM2.5\\u201310 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.006, both Dunnett t-test; see Fig.\\u00a0). Zn showed only a modest increase after exposures to UFPM (p\\u2009=\\u20090.043, Dunnett t-test; see Fig.\\u00a0). Figure 2Metal accumulation in the rat brain after short, intermediate and long exposures to PM polluted air. (A) Ni, (B) Co and (C) Zn show significant accumulations after PM exposures of intermediate durations (1\\u20133 months). Data are shown as mean\\u2009+\\u2009S.E.M. Statistical significance is indicated as p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 (*) and p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 (**).\\n\\n\\n\\nInterestingly, no accumulation of Ni, Co or Zn was observed after long term PM exposures of up to 12 months (Fig.\\u00a0). Only a slight increase in the cerebral Ni content was observed for the PM2.5\\u201310 and PM<2.5 exposure groups, however, this was not significant (Fig.\\u00a0). Thus, cerebral contents of Ni, Co and Zn are significantly increased after intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 and UFPM. This accumulation is transient.\\n\\nCoarse PM causes upregulation of inflammation and cancer-related genesWe next analyzed the expression levels of eight genes that are linked to neuro-endocrine responses, proliferation, inflammation, and tumor development (Table\\u00a0). None of the genes showed different expression levels after short term exposures to PM. However, after intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310, we observed a significant upregulation of four genes in the brains of the exposed rats (Fig.\\u00a0). Specifically, expression of the early growth response gene-2 was significantly increased after intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 (Fig.\\u00a0; EGR2; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0012, Welch\\u2019s test and p\\u2009=\\u20090.0232 by FDR test). EGR2 is a transcription factor that modulates inflammatory responses\\u00a0and is known to promote the development of non-small cell lung carcinoma,. The genes encoding the interleukin (IL) receptor-13\\u03b11 (IL-13R\\u03b11, p\\u2009=\\u20090.0009, Welch\\u2019s test and p\\u2009=\\u20090.0219 by FDR test) and the cytokine IL-16 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.0027 by Welch\\u2019s test and p\\u2009=\\u20090.0426 by FDR test) were concomitantly upregulated after intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 (Fig.\\u00a0); expression\\u00a0of these genes is a good indicator for inflammation\\u00a0and tumorigenesis\\u2013. Finally, we observed upregulation of the Ras-related botulinum toxin substrate 1 (RAC1) gene after intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 (Fig.\\u00a0; p\\u2009=\\u20090.005 by Welch\\u2019s test and p\\u2009=\\u20090.0669 by FDR test). RAC-1 activity has been associated with various types of cancer,.Table 2Primers used for Fluidigm BioMarkTM microfluidic qPCR gene expression analysis of rat brain tissue after exposure to PM.\\n\\nPrimer#Gene(Full Name)Gene symbolGene TypeAssay IDExon Boundary\\\/Assay LocationAmplicon Length1Glycoprotein hormone, \\u03b1 polypeptideCgaPituitaryhormoneRn01440184_m13-4\\\/376562Growthhormone 1Gh1PeptidehormoneRn01495894_g11-2\\\/69603ProlactinProPeptide hormone, developmentRn00561791_m13-4\\\/493864Thyroid Hormone, \\u03b2 subunitTsh\\u03b21PeptidehormoneRn00565424_m11-2\\\/72745Interleukin 13 Receptor \\u03b11IL13\\u03b11Cytokine receptorRn01457340_g11-1\\\/2721236Interleukin 16IL-16CytokineRn01477715_m118-19\\\/3974647Ras-related botulinum toxin substrate 1RAC-1G-proteinRn01412766_m14-5\\\/289868Early growth response gene 2EGR2Transcription factorRn00586224_m11-2\\\/512679GAPDHGAPDHDehydrogenaseRn01775763_g11-1\\\/115417410ActinActinCytoskeletal proteinRn00667869_m14-5\\\/88491Figure 3Expression of genes related to inflammation (EGR2, IL13R\\u03b11, IL16) and cancer (RAC1) in the rat brain after intermediate exposures to PM (1 month). All genes are upregulated after intermediate-length exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 (A) but not PM<2.5 (B) nor UFPM (C). Data are shown as mean\\u2009+\\u2009S.E.M. Statistical significance is indicated as p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 (*), p\\u2009<\\u20090.001 (**).\\n\\n\\n\\nCrucially, the four above-mentioned genes were only upregulated after intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310. No difference in gene expression was observed in rats that received intermediate-length exposures to PM<2.5 (Fig.\\u00a0) or UFPM (Fig.\\u00a0). In addition, none of the genes were overexpressed following prolonged exposures to PM for up to one year. Instead, several genes appeared to be downregulated in PM<2.5 and UFPM exposure groups (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a0). Taken together, these data show that intermediate exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 cause a transient expression of inflammation and cancer biomarkers in the rat brain.\\n\\nA correlation between Ni accumulation and gene upregulationBased on our findings, we conclude that PM2.5\\u201310 cause upregulation of four inflammation and cancer related genes in the rat brain. Because we also observed significant accumulations of Ni and Co following exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 (i.e., Fig.\\u00a0), we next asked if there was a link between these metals and gene upregulation. The resulting Spearman\\u2019s correlation analysis is shown in Fig.\\u00a0. The strength of metal accumulation to gene expression correlations are indicated by color and circle size, where a large red circle indicates a maximum correlation. Only Ni accumulation correlated consistently with upregulated gene expression. Specifically, accumulated Ni and EGR2 gene expression were significantly correlated (see asterisks in Fig.\\u00a0; rho\\u2009=\\u20090.508; p\\u2009=\\u20090.0492). Moreover, Ni and IL-13R\\u03b11 expression were strongly correlated (rho\\u2009=\\u20090.577; p\\u2009=\\u20090.019), while RAC1 expression and Ni accumulation were also correlated (rho\\u2009=\\u20090.512; p\\u2009=\\u20090.042).Figure 4Spearman correlation between metals found in PM and genes indicative of inflammation and cancer. Significant correlations between Ni accumulation and several upregulated genes were observed and are indicated with asterisks. Co and Zn accumulation did not correlate with increased gene expression, whereby the small orange circles in the Co group may be regarded as indices for a weak correlation. The color scale indicates Spearman rho values; strong associations are colored red (rho\\u2009=\\u20091). The size of the circle also indicates the strength of the correlation, with a larger circle indicating more evidence in support of correlations (rho\\u2009=\\u20091). Statistical significance is indicated as p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 (*).\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite indices for a correlation between accumulated Co and EGR2 expression (rho\\u2009=\\u20090.484; p\\u2009=\\u20090.067), no statistical significance was observed between Co accumulation and gene expression (but see small red circles in Co row). Finally, Zn accumulation lacked any indices for correlating with upregulated gene expression (see small or absent circles in Zn row in Fig.\\u00a0). Thus, we identify a specific association between accumulated Ni with the expression of inflammation- and cancer related genes. Ni may thus be a partial trigger of gene upregulation in response to PM2.5\\u201310 exposures.\\n\\nDiscussionAmbient air pollution contains ubiquitous PM that vary in size and composition. Each PM type has a unique toxicological signature which may determine its interactions with molecular cascades in impact organs. We exposed rats separately to PM2.5\\u201310, PM<2.5 and UFPM from Riverside, California. We show that PM2.5\\u201310 and UFPM exposures lead to cerebral metal accumulation. However, only the PM2.5\\u201310 exposures triggered upregulation of inflammation and cancer-related genes. Based on known toxicological profiles of ambient PM from Southern California, we conclude that combinatorial exposures to certain metals and toxins in PM2.5\\u201310 are necessary and responsible for the expression of inflammation and cancer-related biomarkers. This hypothesis is summarized in Fig.\\u00a0 and discussed in more detail below.Figure 5Working hypothesis to explain gene upregulation observed following PM2.5\\u201310 exposures. PM2.5\\u201310 contains both nickel (see Table\\u00a0) and LPS (see text) and triggers upregulation of several genes. PM<2.5 contain nickel (see Table\\u00a0) and LPS (see text) but presumably deposit poorly in the nasal and endotracheal airways (see text); hence no Ni accumulation was observed after PM<2.5 exposures. UFPM contain nickel (Table\\u00a0) but are not always associated with LPS, and do not trigger gene upregulation. Thus, the combination of Ni accumulation and LPS appears to be required to trigger gene upregulation; additional toxins and metals that are not mentioned here are likely contributing factors.\\n\\n\\n\\nCombinatorial toxicity of metals and other toxins in PM2.5\\u201310The PM2.5\\u201310 that we used in exposure experiments contained Ni (see Table\\u00a0) and led to cerebral Ni accumulation (Fig.\\u00a0). A previous analysis of PM2.5\\u201310 from Southern California concluded that endotoxin concentrations are elevated in ambient PM from Riverside. Endotoxins, or bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS), are potent triggers of inflammatory responses in pulmonary, cardiovascular, and brain tissue,\\u2013. We thus hypothesize that the combined exposure to metals (i.e., Ni) and LPS contained in ambient PM2.5\\u201310 from Riverside triggered upregulation of EGR2, IL-16, IL-13R\\u03b11 and RAC-1 and putatively an inflammatory response in rat brains (Fig.\\u00a0).\\n\\nNo gene upregulation was observed following intermediate-length exposures to PM<2.5. PM<2.5 contain metals (see Table\\u00a0) and LPS. However, PM<2.5 deposit poorly in rat airways. Tissue deposition of PM is governed by inertia and Brownian diffusion, which favor the deposition of micrometer-sized coarse PM and nanometer-sized UFPM, respectively. Fine PM<2.5 is too light for deposition by inertia and too large for absorption via Brownian diffusion, and thus accumulates only marginally in nasal and endotracheal\\\/pulmonary airways,. Ultimately, this limits the interaction between PM<2.5 and biological tissues, and hence, the transfer of toxic metals and LPS to impacted organs. This would explain why we failed to observe cerebral Ni accumulation (Fig.\\u00a0) and gene upregulation (Fig.\\u00a0) following exposures to PM<2.5 (Fig.\\u00a0).\\n\\nFinally, UFPM contain toxic metals (Table\\u00a0) and UFPM exposures lead to cerebral Ni accumulation (Fig.\\u00a0). However, UFPM in Southern California may not always contain LPS, and do not correlate in ambient concentration or distribution with endotoxins, suggesting that endotoxins present themselves independently of UFPM. Indeed, we observed that UFPM do not trigger the expression of EGR2, IL-16, IL-13R\\u03b11 and RAC-1 in rat brains (Fig.\\u00a0) and we therefore conclude that (1) adequate PM deposition, (2) Ni (or other metal) accumulation and (3) LPS (or other toxin) exposures were necessary to induce the upregulation of the gene repertoire studied in this experiment.\\n\\nOur findings are consistent with prior reports of synergistic toxicological effects of multiple PM components. Dong et al. (1996) demonstrated that upregulation of inflammatory cytokines in alveolar macrophages occurred in response to urban air and diesel exhaust, but only if air and exhaust particles contained LPS. A similar result was recently published by. Farina et al. (2013) reported greater toxicity and pathological effects of Milano-sourced PM10 during the summer months, when concentrations of toxic LPS are elevated. More recently, Woodward et al. demonstrated that LPS and nano-sized PM (<0.2\\u2009\\u03bcm) trigger glial inflammatory responses via activation of the toll-like 4 receptor. Twenty-five percent of the genes that were upregulated in response to either LPS or PM were shared, suggesting a synergistic interplay between PM, LPS and molecular signaling pathways. Finally, Ni is one of the most frequently identified metals in airborne PM\\u2013 and multiple studies show that Ni is correlated with cardiovascular abnormalities,. However, Ying et al. (2013) demonstrated that Ni exposures alone are not effective in inducing cardiovascular tissue responses, and that these occur only in tissue exposed to Ni and LPS. Combinatorial interactions of metals with other PM components and toxins are therefore required to induce molecular signaling pathways that induce tissue inflammation.\\n\\nHow do PM2.5\\u201310 affect the brain?We showed that exposures to PM2.5\\u201310 triggered the expression of genes related to inflammation and oncogenesis in rat brains. How do exposures to coarse ambient PM result in brain inflammation? Two routes may be considered. First, coarse PM deposit efficiently in superficial airways and to some degree in the lung,. Trace metals, endotoxins and other soluble compounds that are present on the coarse PM can leach into the fluids lining the airways, interact with tissue, and trigger the production of reactive oxygen species via Fenton or Fenton-like reactions (i.e., metals), or activate molecular signaling cascades that initiate tissue inflammation (i.e., LPS). Pro-inflammatory and inflammatory factors may then be released into the bloodstream to interact with- and disrupt the blood brain barrier (BBB). Additional cytokines, monocytes and macrophages can enter the brain via the disrupted BBB to trigger local inflammatory responses,. This may explain why brains from individuals in highly polluted cities have increased monocyte infiltration, activated microglia, increased interleukin activity, BBB damage and localized brain lesions,,.\\n\\nA second route for coarse PM to induce brain inflammation exists via the olfactory system. Coarse PM deposit efficiently in the rat olfactory epithelium and leach soluble metals and toxins into the nasal mucosa. Toxic metals translocate directly into olfactory sensory neurons and are transported along their axons into the olfactory bulbs\\u2013. Once inside the olfactory bulbs, metals and other UFPM may trigger local immune responses, or infiltrate upstream brain regions, to trigger additional inflammatory responses. This presumably occurs via synergistic interactions with other toxins (e.g., LPS), cytokines and macrophages that have gained access to the brain via the same route, or via a compromised BBB, as described before. Coarse PM thus pose significant challenges to the normal function and health of the brain and it will be instructive to study the interplay between this type of pollution with molecular mechanisms of inflammation and disease in more detail.\\n\\nInflammation and cancer-related genes as proxies for neurological disordersGene expression analysis of rat brains revealed changes in several genes related to inflammation following exposures to PM2.5\\u201310. A previous study by our group identified changes in gene expression in rat brains after exposure to coarse PM via by RNA-seq analysis. Based on these data, we investigated the expression of eight genes (Table\\u00a0) that could be affected by pollution exposures and may play important roles in the molecular changes that precede brain pathology.\\n\\nWe found a transient upregulation of IL16 and IL-13R\\u03b11. Tissue expression of IL16 recruits and attracts a variety of immune response cells, including monocytes and dendritic cells. The IL-13R\\u03b11 gene, on the other hand, encodes a receptor subunit of IL13 and IL4 receptors; cytokine receptors of this variant are implicated in diverse regulatory and pathological processes, including alternative macrophage activation and neurodegenerative disorder. EGR2 is an important modulator of immune responses, and acts primarily to suppress them. EGR2 has been linked to autoimmunity and various immune responses related to cancer,. Thus, the collective upregulation of IL16, IL-13R\\u03b1 and EGR2 genes is a strong indication of an ongoing inflammatory process.\\n\\nActivity and\\\/or expression of the above-mentioned genes has, on multiple occasions, been linked to cancer. For example, IL-13R\\u03b12 plays a role in the development of glioblastoma multiforme\\u2013 and is associated with human and canine astrocytoma. IL-16 immunoreactivity has been correlated to increasing grades of human astrocytic brain tumors and EGR2 expression has been linked to human glioblastomas. RAC1 is one of the most commonly mutated oncogenes in human cancers and has been linked to\\u00a0aberrant cell cycle progression and survival, growth factor\\u2013induced membrane ruffling and other signaling mechanisms in glioblastoma multiforme. Thus, the genes that we have found to be upregulated in response to PM2.5\\u201310 are proxies that signal developing or ongoing brain inflammation and oncogenic mechanisms. Our data thus provide another putative link between PM pollution and brain pathology.\\n\\nConclusionIn the present study we show how PM2.5\\u201310 from the Los Angeles basin urban area can trigger the expression of inflammation and cancer-related biomarkers in the rat brain. Our data show that PM induced toxicity is caused by synergistic effects of metals and toxins that are uniquely present in some PM types. Our findings may be unique to the Los Angeles Basin, and may depend heavily on the air pollution composition in this region. Other large urban settlements likely contain differently composed air pollution mixtures, however, there are\\u00a0many examples of potentially deleterious effects of pollution exposures in major cities,,,. Our modern society is becoming increasingly urbanized and exposed to more and more air pollution. This underscores the need for additional research on the biology of air pollution-induced organ damage and\\\/or a concerted political effort aimed at reducing ambient air pollution levels.\\n\\nMethodsParticle isolation and characterizationWe used the versatile aerosol enrichment system (VACES), coupled to size-selective inlets, to isolate and concentrate coarse (PM2.5\\u201310: 2.5\\u201310\\u2009\\u00b5m), fine (PM<2.5: <2.5\\u2009\\u00b5m) and ultrafine particles (UFPM: <0.25\\u2009\\u00b5m) from ambient air pollution. The VACES has been described in detail in, and a similar experimental application as for the present study in. The exposure location was Riverside, CA. Riverside is downwind from Los Angeles and has high regional pollution mixed with vehicular emissions, which originate from a freeway near the exposure site. Exposures were centered around the summer months. Detailed descriptions of the exposure method are available in,.\\n\\nPhysical and chemical characterization of PM was conducted based on samples that were collected from filters installed upstream of the exposure chambers. PM were collected for four days collected on 25\\u2009mm Teflon filters (Zefluor 1-mm port; Pall Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI), which were weighed before and after each exposure session. Elemental and carbon contents were measured from PM collected on pre-baked quartz filters (Tissuequartz, Pall Corporation) after four cumulative days of exposures. The quartz filters were stored after each exposure session, and re-used in subsequent exposure sessions. Elemental and organic carbons were determined using the thermal MnO2 oxidation method by Atmoslytic Inc. (Calabasas, CA). Particle concentrations of PM<2.5 and UFPM were measured using a TSI 3022 Condensation Particle Counter (TSI Incorporated, Shoreview, MN). Details on PM mass and composition in this experiment are supplied in Supplementary Table\\u00a0.\\n\\nAnimal exposures to PMAll animal experiments were performed in accordance with the protocols approved by the University of California at Irvine (IACUC Protocol # 2001\\u20132242) and the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Protocol #9121). Fisher rats aged 8\\u201310 weeks were obtained from Harlan, Inc. (Indianapolis, IN) and fed LabDiet\\u00ae 5001 rodent food (PMI\\u00ae Nutrition International, LLC, Brentwood, MO). One hundred rats (6\\u201310 rats per group) were used for our experiments.\\n\\nRats were exposed to PM for 5\\u2009hours daily, 4 days per week for either two weeks (short), one\\u00a0month (intermediate), three months (intermediate), or 12 months (long). Results from one and three month conditions were pooled for all analyses\\u00a0in this paper.\\u00a0Control experiments were carried out with a cohort of rats that were exposed to filtered air for the same durations as the rats in the PM exposure groups. Filtered air was produced by passing air through an activated carbon filter and then a HEPA filter.\\n\\nMetal content analysisMetal analysis of PM and of brain tissue was performed by the GLP certified laboratory Exova (Santa Fe, CA) using Inductively Coupled Plasma Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (ICP-AES). PM2.5\\u201310, PM<2.5 and UFPM were first collected at a flow rate of 0.5\\u2009L\\\/min on 37\\u2009mm Teflon filters (PTFE 2, Gelman Science, Ann Arbor, MI). PM samples were then digested in 1\\u2009mL nitric acid (36%w\\\/v) and 1\\u2009mL hydrochloric acid (86%w\\\/v) for 1\\u2009hour at 110\\u2009\\u00b0C on a heated plate. The samples were then allowed to cool and the digestion was resumed for another 30\\u2009minutes in 0.5\\u2009ml hydrogen peroxide (30%w\\\/v). Samples were again cooled, internal standards were added, and then diluted to a final mass of 20\\u2009g. A total of 11 heavy metals were tested and six of them were found in detectable quantities (Table\\u00a0).\\n\\nMetal analysis of brain tissue was conducted on brains that were obtained 24\\u2009hours after the last exposure. Rats were euthanized and brains were promptly harvested. Each brain was cut in half along the mid-sagittal plane to yield two equal hemispheres; one hemisphere was used for metal analysis and the other was used for molecular analysis (see below). Whole hemispheres were weighed and homogenized and treated for 1\\u2009hour at 110\\u2009\\u00b0C with a mixture of 0.5\\u2009ml nitric acid (36%w\\\/v) and 0.5\\u2009ml hydrochloric acid (86%w\\\/v). After cooling, 0.5\\u2009ml hydrogen peroxide (30%w\\\/v) was added, and the samples were incubated for an additional 30\\u2009minutes. Internal standards were added and the samples were then diluted with distilled water to a final mass of 5\\u2009g. Metals that were initially found in PM\\u00a0were then analyzed in the brain samples.\\n\\nIsolation of total RNA and cDNA synthesisApproximately equal sized hemispheres from each rat brain were used for gene microarray analysis (see above for extraction and dissection method). RNA was isolated from frozen brain tissue using TRIZOL (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and stored at \\u221280\\u2009\\u00b0C. Total RNA quality was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). Sample concentration and purity was assessed using a NanoDrop\\u00ae ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE).\\n\\nFrom each group, 1\\u2009\\u03bcg of RNA was reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA using the Invitrogen High Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcriptase Kit (Life Technologies) using random primers. The RT reaction mix (10X RT buffer, 25x dNTP mix, 10X random primers, ThermoFisher Multiscribe reverse transcriptase, RNase inhibitor) was diluted with nuclease free water to a total volume of 20\\u2009\\u03bcl. Reactions were cycled on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as follows: 25\\u2009\\u00b0C for 10\\u2009minutes, 37\\u2009\\u00b0C for 120\\u2009minutes, followed by inactivation at 85\\u2009\\u00b0C for 5\\u2009minutes.\\n\\nFluidigm BiomarkTM microfluidic qPCR assayA microfluidic qPCR was performed as previously described. Briefly, for pre-amplification of target genes, 1.25\\u2009\\u03bcl of cDNA template was mixed with 3.75\\u2009\\u03bcl of reaction mix containing 2.5\\u2009\\u03bcl of Preamp Master Mix (Life Technologies) and 1.25\\u2009\\u03bcl of pooled 0.2X TaqMan assays (Applied Biosystems) making for a final pre-amplification reaction volume of 5\\u2009\\u03bcl. Validated TaqMan assay primer sets (Table\\u00a0) for each rat gene were obtained. Pre-amplification of target genes was performed using a ABI thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: 95\\u2009\\u00b0C for 2\\u2009minutes to inactivate RT and to activate Platinum Taq polymerase followed by 20 cycles of 15\\u2009seconds at 95\\u2009\\u00b0C and 4\\u2009minutes at 60\\u2009\\u00b0C, and finally cooled at 4\\u2009\\u00b0C (Fluidigm, Advanced Development Protocol #41: Single-Cell Gene Expression Using SsoFast EvaGreen SuperMix, BioMarkTM HD System). Any unincorporated primers were digested according to the Fluidigm protocol using ExoSAP (Affimetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and the gene targets were diluted and loaded into a 48.48 Dynamic array IFC (Fluidigm, San Francisco, CA) using integrated microfluidic circuitry as per manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. The 48.48 Dynamic array IFC was loaded using three to five biological replicates for each group with three experimental triplicates for each sample. A serial dilution of commercial reference samples (Universal Rat Reference RNA, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA) was also included directly on the chip to validate primer set amplification conditions. Two sets of separate primers were used for specific genes under investigation. The 48.48 Dynamic array IFC was run using a BiomarkTM HD (Fluidigm) according to manufacturer\\u2019s instructions and the cycle threshold of each gene was determined by the Cedars-Sinai\\u00a0genomics core.\\n\\nStatistical and enrichment analysisHeavy metal amounts in rat brains after PM exposures were compared to metal contents after exposures to filtered air. A one-way ANOVA and post-hoc t-tests were used to analyze metal accumulation in brains from each exposure condition vs. brains from matched filtered air controls. Statistical significance was set at p\\u2009<\\u20090.05. Data are expressed as means and their standard error means. Sample sizes were generally 5\\u20136 brains per group.\\n\\nFor qPCR data, the \\u0394CT method was used to determine fold change between samples. Briefly, the \\u0394CT for each target gene was determined by subtracting the threshold (CT) value for actin\\u2009+\\u2009GAPDH from the CT value for the target gene. The raw CT values for actin and GAPDH were highly comparable. The Welch\\u2019s t-test and False Discovery Rate (FDR) test were performed to compare the differences in \\u0394CT between filtered air and other particulate groups. Data were expressed as mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009SEM and differences were considered statistically significant if p\\u2009<\\u20090.05 for the Welch\\u2019s t-test and if p\\u2009<\\u20090.1 for FDR test.\\n\\nTo identify the potential correlations between gene expression (\\u0394CT) and heavy metal content (ppm), a non-parametric Spearman Rho correlation was performed and the correlation plot was generated by Corrplot Package version 0.77 in R v3.3.1. This analysis assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function. Rho values \\u22650.5 and \\u2264\\u22120.5 with p-values of \\u22640.05 were considered significant.\\n\\nData Availability StatementThe authors declare that they will make materials, data and associated protocols promptly available to readers without undue qualifications in material transfer agreements.\\n\\nElectronic supplementary material\\nSupplementary Information\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"Particulate Matter\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"RAC1\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of RAC1 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Air Pollutants\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"EGR2\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of EGR2 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Particulate Matter\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"EGR2\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of EGR2 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Particulate Matter\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"IL16\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of IL16 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Air Pollutants\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"IL16\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of IL16 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Particulate Matter\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"IL13RA1\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of IL13RA1 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Air Pollutants\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"IL13RA1\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of IL13RA1 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Air Pollutants\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"RAC1\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[Air Pollutants results in increased abundance of Particulate Matter] which results in increased expression of RAC1 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^abundance|increases^expression\"}]"}]}

IntroductionDiabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), also known as diabetic heart disease, was originally put forward by Rubler in 1972 []. In recent years, DCM has imposed an increasing social and economic burden with an increase in the number of diabetics. Increasing evidence demonstrates that hyperglycemia induces apoptotic of cardiomyocytes, resulting in the development of DCM through different mechanisms [,], including oxidative stress and the Bax pathway. On the one hand, hyperglycemia may induce excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that is regarded as the most important contributor in the occurrence and progression of DCM [], causing oxidative stress and eventually promoting cell apoptosis. Recent studies suggested that accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) under hyperglycemic conditions contributed to the development of diabetic complications. AGEs exert their effects directly or by binding their member receptor, receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), to activate the downstream signaling pathway []. Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) is an essential intracellular signaling pathway involved in cell growth, apoptosis, and a series of physiological and pathological processes []. Advanced glycation end products-Receptor for advanced glycation end products (AGE-RAGE) interaction can induce pathophysiological cascades linked to the downstream activation of NF-\\u03baB, which in turn leads to ROS generation [], and enhance the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, which can lead to the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes []. On the other hand, hyperglycemia also can lead to cell apoptosis through activation of Bax signaling pathway.\\n\\nTraditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has been attracting more and more attention because of its prominent advantages, stable curative effects, and low toxicity in comparison to Western medicines [,]. Cornus officinalis Sieb.et Zucc, (Cornaceae), a deciduous tree native to the Eastern Asia, distributed mainly in China, as well as Korea and Japan, known as \\u201cShanzhuyu\\u201d in Chinese, often appeared in traditional Chinese medicine formulations, such as liu-wei-di-huang pills, for the treatment of diabetes []. It has also been reported that morroniside was a major active component of Cornus officinalis and had a markedly anti-diabetic effect via reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis []. Moreover, previous study from our lab has demonstrated that morroniside had a protective effect on high glucose-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis []. The content of morroniside from the iridoid glycoside fraction of Cornus officinalis (219.5 mg\\\/g) is the highest. So morroniside is regarded as main active components in Cornus officinalis []. Wang et al. research showed that the activity of SOD and the content of glutathione were significantly improved. Additionally, expression of caspase-3 in rat ischemic cortex tissue was decreased after treatment with morroniside []. Dioscorea opposita Thunb, (Dioscoreaceae), known as \\u201cShanyao\\u201d in Chinese, is classified as medicinal and edible plant in traditional Chinese medicine [] and also used as herb pairs of Cornus officinalis in the prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine dictionary for the treatment of diabetes []. Literature has reported that diosgenin was major a steroidal saponin in yam and the main metabolite of the steroidal saponins in vivo []. It had significantly protective effect on diabetes by attenuating the activities of carbohydrate metabolic enzymes []. In addition, diosgenin has potential effects on cardiovascular diseases and insulin secretion in STZ induced diabetic rats []. However, the protective effect of combination of morroniside and diosgenin on DCM has so far not been experimentally researched. Therefore, it aroused our interests to explore if the protective effect of combination of Mor and Dio played a crucial role on cardiomyocytes via the underlying mechanisms of multi-components on multi-targets during the development and progression of DCM.\\n\\nWe hypothesized that M + D exerted their myocardial protective effect on DCM through activation of the Bax signaling pathway. Furthermore, the advantage of M + D compared with Mor, Dio and the positive drugs (Met) would be discussed. To prove this hypothesis, we detected cell viability and apoptosis by MTT assay and TUNEL staining, ROS by using the fluorescent probe dichlorofluorescein diacetate bis (DCFH-DA), Bcl-2\\\/Bax, and the expression levels of caspase-3 protein by Western blotting.\\n\\n2. Results2.1. Effects of (M + D)H on Cell ViabilityCell viability is shown in  using the MTT assay. At 72 h after high glucose injury in cardiomyocytes, in HG group, the proliferation of cardiomyocytes was markedly decreased compared with the CC group. However, in the MorH group (100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), the DioH group (100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), and the (M + D)H group (100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), the proliferation of cardiomyocytes was significantly increased compared to that in the HG group (p < 0.01). There was no obvious statistical difference between (M + D) group and Mor or Dio groups. The results of the MTT assay showed that MorH, DioH, and (M + D)H had an obviously protective effect on high glucose-induced cardiomyocytes injury. Then, MorH, DioH, and (M + D)H were, therefore, mainly used in subsequent experimental comparisons.\\n\\n2.2. Effects of (M + D)H on Cell ApoptosisApoptosis assay was measured with TUNEL staining. Cells with green nuclei were considered apoptotic, and our results revealed that few cells with nuclei stained green were observed in the (M + D)H group (). After being exposed to HG for 48 h, compared with the CC group, the total cell numbers were significantly reduced, and approximately 91.53% of cells showed apoptotic hallmarks. Compared with the HG group, (M + D)H significantly reduced the percentage of apoptotic cells to 24.59% (p < 0.01, ), so that the total cell numbers were significantly increased. It was found that Mor, Dio, and M + D could reduce apoptosis of cells to varying degrees. Based on the comparison, (M + D)H was more effective than MorH and DioH in inhibiting apoptosis of cardiomyocytes under hyperglycemic conditions.\\n\\n2.3. Effects of (M + D)H on Intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)The molecular probe DCFH-DA was used to label peroxide in cardiomyocytes. After DCFH-DA, the results revealed that the ROS levels of the HG group were increased to 735.00 \\u00b1 12.82% as compared to the control level (263.75 \\u00b1 5.24%, p < 0.01), yet pretreatment of the cells with (M + D)H (342.51 \\u00b1 31.40%) markedly reduced the ROS levels compared with MorH (434.50 \\u00b1 10.14%), DioH (524.57 \\u00b1 5.73%), and Met (p < 0.01 ). There was no significant difference between Mor or Dio and HG group. Therefore, it was concluded that the cardioprotective effect of M + D was significant and enhanced its antioxidant effect.\\n\\n2.4. Effects of (M + D)H on the Expression Levels of Bax and Bcl-2 ProteinTo determine whether apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was involved in the Bax pathway, we tested expression levels of Bax and Bcl-2 protein. As shown in , the Bcl-2\\\/Bax ratio was decreased significantly in the HG-treated group compared with untreated controls. In contrast, the Mor, Dio, and Met treatment increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax in cardiomyocytes to different degrees. In the (M + D)H-treated group, the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax was markedly increased compared to MorH, DioH, and Met (p < 0.01). Altogether, these data suggested that (M + D)H was the most effective in the aspect of anti-apoptosis via the Bax pathway.\\n\\n2.5. Effects of (M + D)H on the Expression Levels of Caspase-3 ProteinIt is known that HG-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes is tightly regulated by caspase-3 []. Hence, we measured the expression levels of caspase-3 protein in cardiomyocytes by Western blot. As shown in B, HG treatment significantly increased the expression levels of caspase-3 protein. In contrast, cardiomyocytes that were pre-treated with Mor, Dio, M + D and Met exhibited a significant decrease in expression levels of caspase-3 protein compared with the HG-treated cells at the same time point. However, (M + D)H was the most effective compared to MorH, DioH, and Met (p < 0.01). These results indicated that the cardioprotective effect of M + D better inhibited the expression levels of caspase-3 protein through blocking a Bax pathway.\\n\\n2.6. Effects of (M + D)H on Caspase-3 ActivityTo further confirm whether M + D could inhibit caspase-3 activity, we examined caspase-3 activity by using a colorimetric activity assay kit. As illustrated in A, HG resulted in a prominent increase in caspase-3 activity compared to that in the CC group (p < 0.01), whereas the Mor, Dio, and Met reduced the level of caspase-3 activity to varying degrees compared with that of the HG group (p < 0.05). However, in the (M + D)H group, caspase-3 activity can be significantly inhibited compared to that in MorH and DioH group. These data indicated that apoptosis of cardiomyocytes was involved with caspase-3 activity regulated by the Bax pathway.\\n\\n2.7. DiscussionDiabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by hypertrophy and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Numerous mechanisms have been considered to be implicated in the pathogenesis of DCM, such as oxidative stress []. It has been confirmed that hyperglycemia can generate ROS through the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) [], which may eventually lead to cardiomyocyte death []. Moreover, considerable evidence suggests that overproduction of ROS induced by hyperglycemia is a crucial factor in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) [,]. A series of biological damage caused by ROS is a primary contributor to chronic diseases, such as DCM. Accordingly, we observed that the change of ROS among treatment with HG and treatment with Mor, Dio, and M + D. The results indicated the ROS levels in (M + D)H group were obviously decreased, which suggested that M + D could prevent the apoptosis of cardiomyocytes through the effect of the antioxidant, meanwhile, further validating that the combination of Mor and Dio produced greater effects than each component alone.\\n\\nThere is numerous evidence to manifest that apoptosis play an important role in the development of diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM) []. Cardiomyocyte apoptosis is one of the major contributors to the development of myocardial infarcts [,]. In the present study, cardiomyocytes survival and apoptosis rate were monitored through MTT assay and TUNEL staining. These results strongly suggested that M + D had obvious anti-apoptotic effects. However, myocardial apoptosis is a complicated process that is mediated by a series of enzymes and numerous molecules, including the release of cytochrome c, the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, and Bax pathways that can regulate the expression levels of caspase-3 protein []. Caspase-3 is considered to be activated during the final step of the proapoptotic signaling pathway in many cell lines []. In addition, caspase-3 activity can be induced by the proapoptotic Bax family proteins and inhibited by the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins. Bax can neutralize Bcl-2 actions by forming heterodimers with Bcl-2 [,]. Of course, previous investigations have also shown that a decrease in anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and an increase in proapoptotic Bax family proteins are associated with the process of apoptosis []. Thus, we monitored the expression levels of caspase-3, Bcl-2, and Bax protein. In the current study, we found that M + D significantly inhibited the cell apoptosis through suppressing the expression of Bax proteins, and increasing the expression of Bcl-2 proteins so as to maintain the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax balance, which further demonstrated that the combination of Mor and Dio produced the greatest protective effect on DCM via the Bax signaling pathway. Additionally, there are also studies demonstrating that overproduction of ROS increases the Bax\\\/Bcl-2 expression ratio, which can decrease mtPTP and subsequently mediate the expression levels of caspase-3 [,]. Therefore, we also concluded that M + D exerted its anti-apoptotic effect by eliminating ROS production.\\n\\nIt is reasonable to speculate that this result could be mainly attributed by different molecular mechanisms of Mor and Dio. Meanwhile, these findings may also provide valuable insight on the possible effects and use of M + D as a feasible therapeutic option for the treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy. In addition, we will do a direct comparison of the activity of the plant extract and the pure compound and further confirm the effect of M + D. Furthermore, we will do further study to perform a quantitative analysis of the drug combination and compare different concentrations and proportions of Mor + Dio.\\n\\n3. Materials and Methods3.1.

Ltd. (Nanjing, China).\\n\\n3.2. Primary Culture of Rat CardiomyocytesIn this experiment, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were prepared from 1\\u20133 day old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described []. The hearts of neonatal SD rats were dissected and digested with 0.125% trypsin until a single cardiomyocyte was obtained. Then the dissociated cells were maintained in Dulbecco\\u2019s modified Eagle\\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37 \\u00b0C, and incubated in 5% CO2 incubator.\\n\\n3.3. GroupingAfter 24 h cultured, rat cardiomyocytes were randomly divided into twelve groups: (1) control group without any treatment (CC); (2) high glucose model group (HG), pretreated with glucose (30 mM); (3) the positive group (Met), pretreated with metformin; (4\\u20136) Morronisid group (Mor), pretreated with Mor at concentrations of 25, 50 or 100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL, which were respectively called MorL, MorM or MorH; (7\\u20139) Diosgenin group (Dio), pretreated with Dio at concentrations of 25, 50, or 100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL, which were called DioL, DioM, or DioH; (10\\u201312) M+D group, pretreated with Mor (25 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), then cardiomyocytes were pretreated with Dio (25 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), which were called (M + D)L (25 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), (M + D)M (50 \\u03bcg\\\/mL), or (M + D)H (100 \\u03bcg\\\/mL). The cells were pretreated with Mor, Dio, (M + D), and Met for 12 h before incubation with 30 mM glucose for 72 h. The cardiomyocytes incubation to morronisid and diosgenin is concomitant.\\n\\n3.4. Analysis of Cell Viability by MTT AssayCardiomyocytes were seeded on 96-well plates at a density of 5 \\u00d7 104 cells\\\/mL in 100 \\u03bcL DMEM per well and incubated at 37 \\u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator for 24 h. Then the culture medium was discarded, and the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). After different treatment, the 96-well plates were incubated at 37 \\u00b0C in 5% CO2 incubator for 72 h. Finally, 20 \\u03bcL of the MTT solution (5 mg\\\/mL) was added into each well and the plates were incubated for 4 h. After that, the medium was removed and DMSO (150 \\u03bcL) was added into each well. The optical density (OD) value was determined spectrophotometrically at 490 nm with a microplate reader.\\n\\n3.5. TUNEL StainingCardiomyocytes were evaluated for apoptosis by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl (TUNEL) method, using a commercially available kit according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. The rat cardiomyocytes were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and observed by a fluorescence microscopy (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany).\\n\\n3.6. Detection of Intracellular Reactive Oxygen SpeciesAfter the addition of DCFH-DA to a final concentration of 10 \\u03bcM, rat cardiomyocytes divided into groups were placed in a 37 \\u00b0C at 5% CO2 incubator for 30 min. Then the cells were washed twice with PBS and digested with 0.25% trypsin. After washed twice with PBS again, the cells were plated in 96-well plates with 500 \\u03bcL cell suspension. The fluorescence intensity (excitation wavelength 488 nm and emission wavelength 525 nm) was detected and analyzed by fluorescence enzyme labelling.\\n\\n3.7. Western Blot AnalysisThe cells were lysed with cold lysis buffer and the proteins were electrophoresed on 10% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane []. The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk and then were incubated with the following antibodies: Bcl antibodies (1:5000), Bax antibodies (1:5000), and caspase antibodies (1:5000). Then, the membranes were incubated in 5% milk overnight at 4 \\u00b0C. After washing the membranes three times for 10 min in TBS-T, Primary antibody was removed and incubated with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody IgG (BA1054, 1:5000 dilution) for 1\\u20132 h. After washing the membranes three times in TBS-T again, the antigen\\u2013antibody bands were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence reagent kit and Images were taken using the ChemiDoc XRS system with Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA, USA).\\n\\n3.8. Caspase-3 Activity AssayCaspase-3 activity was measured using a colorimetric activity assay kit (Nanjing biological science and Technology Development Co., Ltd., Nanjing, Jiangsu, China) according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. In brief, rat cardiomyocytes in experimental groups were lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer, placed on ice for 30 min, and then centrifuged at 4 \\u00b0C for 15 min at 16,000 rpm. After determining the protein concentration, the supernatant was incubated with the caspase-3 substrate (Ac-DEVD-PNA) on a 96-well-plate. The activity of caspase-3 was detected at 405 nm by using a microplate reader (Biotek Synergy HT, Winooski, VT, USA).\\n\\n3.9. Statistical AnalysisData were presented as mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed using standard statistical methods (Graph-Pad Prism 5.0, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). Significant differences (p < 0.05) among groups were determined by unpaired Student\\u2019s t test. One-way ANOVA followed by the Student\\u2013Newman\\u2013Keuls test was used to compare the multiple treatment conditions.\\n\\n4. ConclusionsIn conclusion, we found that M + D exerted a profound cardioprotective effect against HG-induced myocardial injury. The underlying mechanisms of M + D-mediated cardioprotection appear to be largely dependent on the regulating of expression of Bcl-2 and Bax protein. Our study not only provides insights into the cardioprotective effect of M + D, but also profoundly clarifies the widely applicable development strategy of traditional Chinese medicines. However, details of the molecular pathways and the therapeutic method of \\u201cmulti-target, multi-drug\\u201d need further study. In addition, the cardioprotective effect of M+D would be further investigated by pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics in vivo. Meanwhile, it will be investigated that whether the protective effect of Cornus officinalis and Dioscorea opposita on DCM is only related to combination of Mor and Dio via metabonomics in vivo. Furthermore, we will conduct further study to confirm the possible synergistic effects between Mor and Dio by calculating the combination index according to standard equations.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the

Reactions were subsequently\\nterminated and separated on SDS\\\/PAGE and analyzed by in-gel fluorescence.\\nPercent inhibition was determined using Image J and IC50 values were calculated.

Significance is expressed in D as *p <\\n0.05 compared with TPPyne2-treated mouse livers.\\n\\nHere, we utilized integrated chemoproteomic and metabolomic\\nplatforms\\nto discover that TPP inhibits several specific carboxylesterase (Ces) enzymes in vivo in mouse liver, alters\\nhepatic lipid metabolism, and causes serum hypertriglyceridemia. We\\nalso present evidence that several additional members of the OPFR\\nchemical class may also inhibit the same set of Ces enzymes that cause these dyslipidemic phenotypes.\\n\\nTo identify\\ndirect protein targets of TPP in vivo in mice, we\\ndeveloped two bioorthogonal chemoproteomic probes that\\nmimic the TPP structure, TPPyne1 and TPPyne2 (Figure A). These probes are TPP analogs that include a bioorthogonal\\nalkyne handle that can be reacted with an analytical tag, such as\\nrhodamine-azide or biotin-azide, by copper-catalyzed click chemistry, for subsequent fluorescent detection or mass-spectrometry-based\\nproteomic identification of probe targets, respectively (Figure B). We pretreated mice with vehicle or TPP (for\\n1 h) prior to administration of mice with the TPPyne probes (for 3\\nh). A rhodamine analytical handle was then appended to the TPPyne-bound\\nproteins in liver lysates ex vivo by click chemistry\\nto visualize probe-bound targets. Interestingly, we found that both\\nprobes labeled several TPP-specific protein targets in vivo in mouse livers, that is, proteins whose labeling by the TPPyne\\nprobes were competed out by TPP preadministration. TPPyne2 showed\\nmore TPP-specific and fewer probe-specific targets compared to TPPyne1,\\nthat is, TPPyne1 showed more nonspecific targets that were not competed\\nby TPP, compared to TPPyne2 (Figure C). Thus,\\nwe proceeded to use TPPyne2 for subsequent proteomic identification\\nof TPP-specific targets.\\n\\nTo identify the in vivo biological targets of\\nTPP, we appended a biotin analytical handle onto proteins labeled\\nby TPPyne2 in liver lysates from the TPPyne2-treated mice using click\\nchemistry, avidin-enriched the probe-labeled proteins, trypsinized\\nthe enriched proteome, and analyzed subsequent tryptic peptides by\\nMultidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT). We identified five protein targets from liver\\nlysates that were significantly enriched by the TPPyne2 probe (p < 0.05) compared with lysates from TPP pretreated TPPyne\\n2-treated mice (Figure D). We interpret these\\ntargets to be TPP-specific protein targets bound in vivo in mouse liver. All five protein targets were Ces enzymes, Ces1f, Ces1g, Ces2a, Ces1e, and Ces1c. Ces enzymes belong to the serine\\nhydrolase superfamily and have collectively been implicated as both\\nliver triacylglycerol hydrolases and detoxification enzymes for carboxylester\\nxenobiotics., In a separate experiment, we tested\\nwhether TPP inhibited the activity of these Ces enzymes,\\nrather than merely binding these proteins in an activity-independent\\nmanner, using activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) coupled to MudPIT\\n(ABPP-MudPIT) with the serine hydrolase activity-based probe, fluorophosphonate-biotin\\n(FP-biotin), ( Figure S1, Figure S2). ABPP uses active-site directed\\nprobes to directly measure the activities of enzymes in complex biological\\nsamples.\\u2212 Previous studies have shown that the serine hydrolase activity-based\\nprobes FP-biotin and FP-rhodamine bind only to active, but not inactive\\nor inhibited, serine hydrolases and can be used to measure the activities\\nof many serine hydrolases, including Ces enzymes.\\u2212 Indeed, using ABPP-MudPIT, we show that Ces1f, Ces1g, Ces2a, Ces1e, and Ces1c activities\\nare inhibited by TPP in vivo.\\n\\nWe reason that\\nthis inhibition of Ces activity\\nis through irreversible phosphorylation of TPP to the Ces active-site serine, as has been shown for other OP compounds ( Figure S3)., As evidence of this irreversible binding, we show that TPPyne2-bound Ces targets are visible on a denaturing SDS\\\/PAGE gel and\\nare enriched and identified by proteomics under denaturing conditions\\n(Figure C, D). To experimentally determine\\nthe nature of this interaction, we generated a catalytically inactive Ces1g Serine 221 to Alanine (S221A) mutant enzyme. We demonstrate\\nthat TPPyne2 labels wild-type Ces1g, but not Ces1g S221A, providing evidence of a covalent interaction\\nat the active-site serine of the enzymes, much like other OP compounds\\nthat phosphorylate the active-site serine of serine hydrolases to\\ncause functional inhibition ( Figure S3). Thus, we propose that TPP likely binds irreversibly\\nto the active-site serine of Ces enzymes. Though\\nmany OP toxicants have been known to elicit their primary mode of\\ntoxicity through acetylcholineterase (AChE) inhibition, we demonstrate\\nthat TPP does not inhibit either acetylcholinesterase (AChE) or butyrylcholinesterase\\n(BChE) activity ( Figure S4).\\n\\nTotal carboxylesterase activity has also been\\npreviously assayed\\nby measuring p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolysis., TPP treatment in vivo in mice significantly inhibits\\ntotal liver p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolytic activity\\nby 43% ( Figure S5A).\\nTo further confirm that TPP inhibits the activities of the specific\\nTPP target Ces enzymes, we next tested whether TPP\\ninhibits p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolytic activity\\nin HEK293T lysates overexpressing the five Ces TPP\\ntargets. Despite ABPP data showing that all five Ces enzymes were overexpressed and active (), Ces1c and Ces1g did\\nnot significantly hydrolyze this substrate (). Only Ces1e, Ces1f,\\nand Ces2a were capable of hydrolyzing p-nitrophenyl acetate. Nonetheless, we show that Ces1e, Ces1f, and Ces2a p-nitrophenyl\\nacetate hydrolytic activity were completely inhibited by TPP in vitro (Figure S5).\\n\\nWe next tested the relative\\npotencies of TPP against the five identified Ces enzyme\\ntargets recombinantly expressed in HEK293T cells.\\nWe found that TPP inhibits Ces1f, Ces1g, Ces2a, Ces1e, and Ces1c by 50% at concentrations (IC50 values) of 5, 1100, 2300,\\n12, and 15 nM, respectively (Figure E), using\\ncompetitive ABPP. These IC50 values are within the realm\\nof potential exposure levels based on the levels of TPP previously\\ndetected in house dust.\\n\\nPrevious\\nwork by Quiroga et al. revealed that genetic ablation\\nof Ces1g (also known as Ces1 or Esterase-X) in mice\\ncaused obesity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperlipidemia. This striking phenotype prompted us to hypothesize\\nthat repeated exposure to TPP may result in similar metabolic alterations.\\nConsistent with this premise, subacute exposure to TPP (once per day\\nover 10 days) in mice led to serum hypertriglyceridemia and increased\\nVLDL and LDL masses (Figure a\\u2013c). Based\\non findings of Quiroga et al., we conjecture that TPP is eliciting\\nthis dyslipidemic phenotype through increased VLDL secretion through\\nhepatic Ces1g blockade, as has been previously shown\\nin Ces1g-deficient mice. Because the role of Ces1f, Ces2a, Ces1e, and Ces1c are unknown\\nin neutral lipid metabolism, it is not clear at present whether the\\neffects of TPP on lipid metabolism are mediated through Ces1g inhibition or through any combination of the target Ces enzymes. Thus, at this time, based on existing evidence, we attribute\\nthe TPP-induced hypertriglyceridemia to Ces1g inactivation,\\nand it will be of future interest to determine the individual and\\ncombinatorial roles of these five Ces enzymes in\\ndyslipidemia. We also show that lipoprotein lipase (IC50 > 100 \\u03bcM) is not inhibited by TPP ( Figure S6), since LPL inhibition may yield similar\\nhypertriglyceridemia phenotypes through impairing uptake of triglycerides\\nfrom VLDL.\\n\\nFigure 2TPP induces hypertriglyceridemia\\nand dysregulated lipoprotein profiles.\\n(A\\u2013C) Subacute TPP treatment in mice (50 mg\\\/kg, ip, once per\\nday over 10 days) raises serum triacylglycerol (TAG) levels (A), and\\nincreased VLDL, IDL, and LDL particle mass (B,C). Lipoprotein profiles\\nand particle mass were determined by ion mobility. Bar graphs in A\\nand C are represented as mean \\u00b1 SEM; n = 7\\u201310\\nmice\\\/per group (A) and n = 3 mice\\\/group (C). Lipoprotein\\nprofiles in B show average values of n = 3 mice\\\/group.\\nSignificance is expressed A and C as *p < 0.05\\ncompared with vehicle-treated mice.\\n\\nWe next wanted to explore the potential mechanism through\\nwhich\\nTPP causes hypertriglyceridemia. Because Ces enzymes\\nare implicated in lipid metabolism, we focused our efforts on profiling\\nthe lipidome by performing liquid chromatography\\\/mass spectrometry\\n(LC\\\/MS)-based metabolomic analysis, to identify\\nbiochemical alterations in the livers of TPP-treated mice. We utilized\\ntargeted single-reaction monitoring (SRM)-based methods to comparatively\\nprofile the levels of >150 lipids in combination with untargeted\\napproaches\\nto broadly profile >20\\u2009000 ions between vehicle and TPP-treated\\nmice. Upon acute in vivo TPP-treatment, we were surprised\\nto find that the only significant changes in the lipidome were increases\\nin the levels of diacylglycerols (DAGs) (Figure A, B;  Table S1).\\nWhile Ces enzymes have been implicated in triacylglycerol\\nhydrolysis, our results may indicate that one or all of the Ces enzymes inhibited by TPP may regulate liver diacylglycerol\\nmetabolism.\\n\\nFigure 3TPP causes alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. (A, B) Metabolomic\\nprofiling of livers from mice acutely treated with TPP (100 mg\\\/kg\\nip, 4 h) in mice. We performed targeted single-reaction monitoring\\n(SRM)-based metabolomics to comparatively profile the levels of \\u223c150\\nknown lipids. We also performed untargeted metabolomic profiling in\\nwhich we collected all mass spectra between m\\\/z 50\\u20131200 and used XCMSOnline to identify, align,\\nintegrate, and compare all detectable ions between control and TPP-treated\\nmice resulting in a comparison of 20\\u2009000 ions. Upon identifying\\nmetabolites that were significantly and reproducibly altered, we found\\nthat acute TPP treatment (A,B) causes elevations in liver diacylglycerol\\n(DAG) levels. (C) Subacute treatments of TPP (50 mg\\\/kg ip) coadministered\\nwith pan-PKC inhibitor G\\u00f6 6983 (10 mg\\\/kg ip) once per day over\\n10 days averts the TPP-induced hypertriglyceridemia. (D,E) Subacute\\nTPP treatment (50 mg\\\/kg ip, once per day over 10 days) leads to broader\\nmetabolomic changes in liver lipid levels, including increase in phospholipid,\\nneutral lipid, fatty acid, and N-acylethanolamine levels as well as\\ndecreases in ether lipid and sphingolipid levels. Shown in (A,D) are\\ntotal ions detected, where data points to the right of the dotted\\nline are ions that were significantly altered, and data points to\\nthe left of the dotted line are ions that were detected but not significantly\\naltered.

Data in B and E represented as mean \\u00b1 SEM; n = 4\\u20135 mice\\\/per group (A, B) and n = 7\\u201310 mice\\\/group (C, D, E). Significance is expressed in\\n(B, C, E) as *p < 0.05 compared with vehicle-treated\\nmice, # p < 0.05 compared to TPP-treated mice.\\n\\nWe thus hypothesized that the\\nobserved increase in serum triglyceride\\nlevels may arise from the initial TPP-induced increases in liver DAG\\nlevels. As DAGs are endogenous ligands for protein kinase C (PKC) and PKC-deficient mice are protected against\\ndyslipidemia, we postulated that DAG stimulation of PKC in the liver\\nmay result in hypertriglyceridemia. Consistent with this premise,\\nsubacute coadministration of the pan-PKC inhibitor G\\u00f6 6983\\nwith TPP over 10 days averts the TPP-induced serum hypertriglyceridemia\\n(Figure C).\\n\\nUpon subacute (10 day) TPP\\ntreatment, we interestingly observed\\nbroader changes in the liver lipidome, not only including increases\\nin DAG levels but also increases in the levels of several phospholipids\\nand lysophospholipids, neutral lipids, and fatty acids, and lowering\\nin the levels of several ether lipids and sphingolipids (Figure D, E;  Table S1). Thus, longer TPP exposure causes widespread alterations\\nin hepatic lipid metabolism.\\n\\nTo examine chemical class-wide\\neffects of other OPFRs currently\\nin use, we tested the inhibitory potential of these chemicals against\\nthe TPP targets identified in this study. While most of the alkylphosphates\\nwere inactive against Ces, we found that many arylphosphate\\nOPFRs inhibited Ces1f, Ces1g, Ces2a, Ces1e, and Ces1c, including cresyldiphenylphosphate (CDPP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenylphosphate\\n(EHDP), tri-meta-cresylphosphate (TMCP), and tri-para-cresylphosphate (TPCP) (Figure f). These results suggest that arylphosphate OPFRs may be a chemotype\\nof concern for eliciting dyslipidemic phenotypes through Ces inhibition. It will be of future interest to perform similar studies\\nwith bioorthogonal mimics of alkylphosphate flame retardant chemicals\\nto identify their potential biological targets in vivo. Previous studies have shown that the OP compound bis-nitrophenylphosphate (BNPP) broadly inhibits Ces enzyme activity. While we show that BNPP inhibits Ces1e, BNPP does not inhibit Ces1g activity. Thus, we would not anticipate that exposure\\nto BNPP would elicit dyslipidemic activity ( Figure S7).\\n\\nIn conclusion, we show here that\\nTPP inhibits a specific subset\\nof liver Ces enzymes. Genetic deletion of one of\\nthese Ces enzymes, Ces1g, has been\\nshown in mice to cause obesity and dyslipidemia. Consistent with TPP\\ninhibition of Ces1g, we show that TPP exposure elicits\\nhypertriglyceridemia, and we find that it likely occurs through heightened\\nliver DAG and PKC signaling and further causes alterations in liver\\nlipid metabolism. We also provide evidence that our findings may apply\\nmore broadly to the class of arylphosphate OPFRs. Previous studies\\nhave shown that TPP inhibits carboxylesterase activity, oftentimes\\nassayed in crude protein mixtures with the nonspecific serine hydrolase\\nsubstrates. However, there are at least 20 different carboxylesterases\\nin mice and several hundred other serine hydrolases. While these carboxylesterases\\nare highly homologous to each other, recent\\nstudies have shown that there may be unique physiological functions\\nfor each carboxylesterase. For example, while Ces1g-deficient mice exhibit obesity, hepatic steatosis, and dyslipidemia,\\npharmacological or genetic ablation of Ces3 show improved glycemia\\nand serum lipid profiles.,, We show here that TPP and other arylphosphate flame retardants inhibit\\nparticular Ces enzymes (Ces1f, Ces1g, Ces2a, Ces1e,\\nand Ces1c) and show that prolonged TPP exposure results\\nin similar phenotypes observed in Ces1g-deficient\\nmice. Thus, in this study, we provide granularity in the specific Ces isoforms that are inhibited by TPP and other OPFRs in\\nmouse liver.\\n\\nPatisaul et al. recently published a provocative\\nstudy showing\\ngestational and lactational exposure of rats to Firemaster 550, which\\ncontains TPP, a mixture of isopropylated triphenylphosphate isomers,\\n2-ethyldexy-2,3,4\\u20135-tetrabromobenzoate (TBB), and bis(2-ethylhexyl)-2,3,4,5-tetrabromopthalate\\n(TBPH), caused hallmarks associated with metabolic syndrome, including\\nincreased serum thyroxine, advanced female puberty, weight gain, male\\ncardiac hypertrophy, and altered exploratory behaviors. The authors concluded that these effects were\\nlikely due to TBB and TBPH acting as endocrine disruptors, and further\\nshowed that overall hepatic Ces activity, assayed\\nby p-nitrophenyl acetate, was inhibited likely due\\nto carboxylesterase metabolism of TBB and TBPH. Our studies suggest instead that the OPFRs in Firemaster\\n550 likely led to the inhibition in overall Ces activity\\ndue to the blockade of specific Ces enzymes. While\\nwe cannot rule out other interactions of TPP with other proteins,\\nor which of the five Ces enzymes may be responsible\\nfor TPP-mediated phenotypes, we provide compelling evidence that OPFRs\\nmay act as dyslipidemic agents through a unique mode of action of\\ninhibiting Ces1g that may be distinct from endocrine\\ndisrupting mechanisms. It will be of future interest to develop more\\nselective inhibitors for individual Ces enzymes to\\ndissect their individual and combined roles in lipid metabolism. Quite\\ninterestingly, while Ces activity has been traditionally\\nassayed through measurement of p-nitrophenyl acetate\\nhydrolysis, we demonstrate that Ces1g does not hydrolyze\\nthis substrate, consistent with previous reports and that the observed inhibition of total liver p-nitrophenyl acetate hydrolytic activity following TPP\\nexposure is likely due to Ces1f inhibition. The inability\\nof Ces1g to turnover p-nitrophenyl\\nacetate likely reflects a tight binding pocket within Ces1g that cannot accomodate di- and triarylphosphonates with substituents\\non the aryl groups, as reflected by the inability of TMCP and TPCP\\nto inhibit Ces1g (Figure F). Thus, traditional Ces activity assays would\\nnot have been able to specifically identify Ces1g as a TPP target. Our findings underscore the importance of chemoproteomic\\nplatforms in identifying direct targets of chemicals to inform novel\\ntoxicological mechanisms.\\n\\nPrevious literature has reported house\\ndust concentrations of TPP\\nup to 1.8 mg TPP\\\/g dust, and an average\\nhousehold contains approximately 1 g of dust. An average small child weighing 12\\u201313 kg carrying \\u223c1\\nL total blood volume would require absorption of merely 0.33 mg TPP\\nto reach a blood concentration of 1000 nM\\u2014a concentration comparable\\nto or greater than the IC50 values of TPP against the Ces enzyme targets identified in this study. Though such\\nan acute exposure may be unlikely, a comprehensive exposure assessment\\nmust consider additional factors, including other sources of TPP exposure,\\nthe effects of chronic TPP exposure, and any compounding effects of\\nother OPFRs and environmental chemicals that may inhibit Ces enzymes. Indeed, a recent study by Meeker et al. examining urinary\\nmetabolites of OPFRs suggests direct, stable sources of exposure,\\nand previous studies examining urinary concentrations of TPP metabolites\\nin humans range up to 28.6 \\u03bcg\\\/L. Furthermore, since these agents are likely acting through irreversible\\nphosphorylation of the Ces active site serine nucleophiles,\\nthe duration of Ces inhibition is dictated by the\\nrate of protein synthesis and turnover, rather than the rate of chemical\\nelimination from the body. Thus, in the current reality of sustained\\nexposure to mixtures of TPP and other OPFRs, even relatively low amounts\\nof TPP may cause a cumulative inhibition of hepatic Ces enzymes. There may also be other environmental chemicals that also\\ninhibit Ces enzymes. Medina-Cleghorn et al. recently\\nfound that chlorpyrifos, a widely used OP insecticide also inhibits\\nmany of the liver Ces enzymes, as well as other serine\\nhydrolases in vivo in mice. It will be of future interest to test whether chronic and low dose\\nTPP exposure will exert dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis, obesity,\\nand other aspects of the metabolic syndrome.\\n\\nWe also demonstrate\\nthe utility of chemoproteomic platforms in\\nidentifying the direct biological targets of environmental chemicals,\\nsuch as OPFRs, to facilitate their toxicological characterization.\\nWe also show that metabolomic platforms can be integrated with chemoproteomic\\nstrategies to inform potential toxicological mechanisms downstream\\nof chemical\\u2013protein interactions. Overall, we put forth that\\nsustained exposure to OPFRs may present a risk to human health by\\npotentially disrupting hepatic lipid metabolism and exerting hypertriglyceridemia\\nthrough a unique mechanism of inhibiting specific liver Ces enzymes.\\n\\nMethodsMethods and any associated\\nreferences are available in the .\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of

To identify Nrf2 activators for the treatment of oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced diseases, the present study developed a high-throughput assay to evaluate Nrf2 activation using AREc32 cells that contain a luciferase gene under the control of ARE promoters. Of the 47,000 compounds screened, 238 (top 0.5% hits) of the chemicals increased the luminescent signal more than 14.4-fold and were re-tested at eleven concentrations in a range of 0.01-30 \\u00b5M.

Results from this screening identified Nrf2 activators, and provide novel insights into chemical scaffolds that might prevent oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionOxidative stress is the consequence of imbalanced production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the ability of cells to detoxify these ROS, which can result in ROS-induced tissue damage. In humans, oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of numerous clinical conditions, including atherosclerosis , Alzheimer's disease , and rheumatoid arthritis . In addition, ROS, together with other electrophiles, are capable of attacking DNA in the nucleus increasing the risk of carcinogenesis .\\n\\nThe Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) - nuclear factor, erythroid derived 2, like 2 (Nrf2) pathway serves as one of the major protective mechanisms in cells in response to oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress. Under basal conditions, Nrf2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm by the cytoskeletal anchoring protein Keap1, and is targeted for ubiquitin-mediated proteasome degradation. Upon the stimuli of oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress, Nrf2 is released from Keap1 and Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus . Once in the nucleus, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with a variety of transcriptional regulatory proteins, including members of the activator protein-1 family (Jun and Fos), and the small Maf family of transcription factors . These protein complexes bind to antioxidant response elements (ARE) located in the upstream promoter region of a battery of genes, and drives their transcription .\\n\\nThe Nrf2 target genes are involved in a variety of cytoprotective events, such as glutathione (GSH) synthesis and recycling (Gclc, Gclm, Gss, Gsr), reduction of hydrogen peroxide (Gpx), reduction of oxidized protein (Txn, Txnrd, Srxn), detoxification of electrophiles (Nqo1, Gst), and excretion of GSH-conjugated electrophiles (Mrp) . Thus, it is not surprising that Nrf2 deficient mice are more susceptible, whereas Nrf2 enhanced mice are resistant to chemical-induced oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress and subsequent tissue injury. For example, compared with wild-type mice, Nrf2-null mice are more susceptible to acetaminophen-induced liver injury , cigarette smoke-induced lung injury , dextran sulfate sodium\\\/azoxymethane-induced colitis and colorectal cancer , and benzo[a]pyrene-induced forestomach cancer . In contrast, Keap1-knockdown and Keap1-hepatoctye knockout mice, in which Nrf2 is constitutively activated, are highly resistant to acetaminophen , diquat , and cadmium -induced lethality and tissue injury. In addition, a number of synthetic and natural compounds protect against oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced toxicity, at least partially through activating Nrf2. For example, curcumin protects against focal ischemia of the cerebrum through upregulation of Nrf2 , and oltipraz protects against ANIT-induced cholestasis through Nrf2 activation .\\n\\nThese data suggest potential therapeutic applications of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, and thus Nrf2 is a promising drug target in the treatment of oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced diseases. A quantitative bioassay evaluating the induction of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (Nqo1), the prototypical Nrf2 target gene, in Hepa1c1c7 murine hepatoma cells was developed and still remains a major screening tool for potential activators of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway . To date, a number of compounds with diverse chemical structures have been shown to activate Keap1-Nrf2, including oxidizable diphenols (tBHQ), dithiolethiones (oltipraz), isothiocyanates (sulforaphane), and Michael acceptors (curcumin, cinnamates, and chalcones) . In an effort to develop more potent and effective activators of the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway, chemical derivatives of known active compounds were synthesized and screened. The most potent known Nrf2 activator, 2-cyano-3,12-dioxoolean-1,9-bien-28-oic acid imidazole (CDDO-Im), is a semisynthetic triterpenoids derived from oleanolic acid . Based on the structure-activity relationship analyses of the oleanolic triterpenoids, (\\u00b1)-(4bS,8aR,10aS)-10a-ethynyl-4b,8,8-trimethyl-3,7-dioxo-3,4b,7,8,8a,9,10,10a-octahydrophenanthrene-2,6-dicarbonitrile (TBE-31), was synthesized. Both CDDO-Im and TBE-31 activate the Keap1-Nrf2 pathway at nano-molar concentrations in vitro and in vivo\\n.\\n\\nDespite the discovery of a few potent Nrf2 activators (CDDO compounds and TBE-31), there is limited information about the chemical scaffolds that can potentially activate Nrf2. Recently, AREc32 cells were engineered. AREc32 cells, which are derived from MCF7 human breast cancer cells, are stably transfected with a luciferase reporter gene construct under the control of eight copies of rat Gsta2 AREs in the promoter region . The AREc32 cells provide a rapid and convenient quantification of Nrf2-ARE induction by chemicals, and makes large scale-screening of Nrf2 activators possible.\\n\\nThe aim of the present study was to develop a high-throughput assay to evaluate Nrf2 activation using the AREc32 cells, screen a library of 47,000 compounds, and to find compounds that are potent and effective activators of Nrf2. In addition, through structural activity relationship analyses, the present study also aimed to discover novel chemical scaffolds that are likely to activate the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Results from this screening identified strong Nrf2 activators, and provide novel insights into chemical scaffolds that might detoxify oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress and prevent oxidative\\\/electrophilic stress-induced toxicity and carcinogenesis.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsCell growth and maintenanceThe AREc32 cells were obtained from CRX biosciences (Dundee, Scotland, UK). The AREc32 are a stable cell line derived from the human MCF7 breast carcinoma cell line with a transfected luciferase gene construct that under the control of eight copies of rat Gsta2 AREs in the promoter region . AREc32 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing glutamax supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and the antibiotic G418 (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA). The cells were grown at 37\\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2.\\n\\nAREc32 cells were seeded into 384-well plates (flat-bottom white, opaque, sterile, with lids) at a density of 3,500 cells\\\/well using a Wellmate bulk dispenser (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) in 50 \\u00b5L of complete media per well. Cell plates were incubated at room temperature for 30 min following seeding to allow for even cell settling. Cell plates were then incubated at 37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in a 95% humidified incubator for 20 hrs.\\n\\nMurine hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and maintained in DMEM with glutamate, supplemented with 10% (v\\\/v) heat-inactivated FBS, penicillin (100 units\\\/ml), and streptomycin (100 \\u00b5g\\\/ml). The cells were maintained at 37\\u00b0C in the presence of 5% CO2.\\n\\nCompound libraries and preparationFour libraries of compounds were screened for Nrf2 activation in the present study: 2000 compounds were obtained from MicroSource Discovery Systems (www.msdiscovery.com\\\/spectrum.html), 1120 compounds were obtained from Prestwick Chemical Library (Prestwick Chemical, Washington, DC), 1920 compounds were obtained from the University of Kansas Center of Excellence in Chemical Methodologies & Library Development (KU-CMLD), and 41,888 compounds were obtained from ChemBridge Small Molecule Library (ChemBridge Corporation, San Diego, CA).\\n\\nThe four libraries of compounds were stored at 2859 \\u00b5M in 100% DMSO, and 175 nL of each compound was transferred to the 50 \\u00b5L cell culture medium in the receiving well. Chembridge library compounds were dispensed by the Matrix PlateMate Plus automated nanoliter capacity liquid handler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), followed by three gentle mixings. Compounds from MicroSource, Prestwick, and CMLD libraries, as well as the compounds for the concentration-response validation, were dispensed by Labcyte Echo 550 Compound Reformatter (Labcyte Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), which allows the accurate transfer of small volumes of liquid. The final concentration of each chemical in the full library screen was 10.0 \\u00b5M, with a DMSO content of 0.35%.\\n\\nQuantification of ARE activation by Promega Steady-Glo luciferase assay systemAREc32 cells were exposed to library compounds for 24 hrs at 37\\u00b0C, 5% CO2 in a 95% humidified incubator, then removed from the incubator and left at room temperature for 20 min to equilibrate the plate and its contents to room temperature. The Matrix Wellmate dispensed Steady-Glo luciferase assay reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) to all cells, 10 \\u00b5L per well, and plates were shaken for 1 min at 1600 rpm. The luminescence intensities were read 30 min later on a Tecan Safire2 microplate reader (M\\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland). The luminescence values used for data analysis were derived from a luciferase reaction (). The Steady-Glo reagent produces cell lysis and generation of a luminescent signal, which is proportional to ARE activation, via the luciferase reporter in the AREc32 cell line.\\n\\nFour controls were used on each plate of cells: (1) cells treated with tBHQ, a known ARE activator (positive control), (2) cells treated with CDDO-Im, a very potent activator of Nrf2\\\/ARE (positive control), (3) cells in media containing 0.35% DMSO (vehicle control), and (4) cells in media containing no DMSO (control cells) to measure background luminescence. The plate map for the controls is displayed in .\\n\\nZ\\u2032 factor for Pass\\\/Fail CriterionThe positive and negative controls were required to assure uniformity from plate to plate, and from screening batch to batch. The controls were used to calculate a Z\\u2032 factor value for each plate, a measure of assay robustness and variability popularly used for high throughput screening. The Z\\u2032 factor compares the baseline background (minimum ARE signal) from the DMSO vehicle control, and the maximum signal of response of the positive controls tBHQ and CDDO-Im , . The Z\\u2032 factor formula relies on the mean and standard deviation of the maximum signal and the minimum baseline, as shown in . In this assay, screening plates were expected to have a Z\\u2032 value equal to or greater than 0.6. Plates with Z\\u2032 values below 0.4 were individually investigated, and rejected or repeated on a plate by plate basis.\\n\\nQuantification of Nqo1 mRNA in Hepa1c1c7 cellsThe top 30 hits from the primary screen were further validated by quantifying the mRNA of Nqo1, a prototypical Nrf2 target gene, in Hepa1c1c7 cells by real time-PCR. Cells were grown in 24-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells per well for 12 hrs, and subsequently incubated with test compounds at 6 concentrations (0.1\\u20133 \\u00b5M) for 24 hrs. After incubation, the medium was decanted and total RNA was isolated using RNAzol B reagent (Tel Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX). cDNA was synthesized with a High Capacity cDNA Archive Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) from total RNA, and the resulting cDNA was used for real-time PCR to quantify Nqo1 mRNA, with \\u03b2-actin used as the internal control. The primer sequences for Nqo1 and \\u03b2-actin are listed in .\\n\\nCompound structure clustering analysisPreliminary hit clustering was based on EC50 values from the concentration-response curves of the top 240 compounds, and accomplished via the Selector program from Tripos via the Jarvis Patrick routine, using default parameters. From each preliminary cluster, the largest conserved substructure present in at least half of the cluster members was identified. Each cluster was then manually edited to remove compounds that did not contain the largest conserved substructure identified in the previous step. Compounds that had not originally been selected to a given cluster but containing the cluster's characteristic conserved substructure were then added to the cluster.\\n\\nInduction of Nqo1 by the top 30 hits from the primary screening in Hepa1c1c7 cellsHepac1c7 cells were seeded into 24-well plates at a density of 30,000 cells\\\/well in 1 mL complete media per well and cultured overnight to allow attachment. Cells were treated the next day with the top 30 compounds from the primary screening and were harvested 24 h after treatment. Total RNA samples were isolated by using RNAzol B reagent (Tel-Test, Inc., Friendswood, TX) according to the manufacturer's protocol, and were reverse-transcribed into cDNA by High Capacity cDNA Archive Kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The resulting cDNA was used for real-time PCR analysis using SYBR\\u00ae Green PCR Master Mix in a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).

To test the luciferase assay signal stability of AREc32 cells, they were seeded at 3,000 cells\\\/well in a 384-well plate, and tBHQ, a typical Nrf2 activator, was added to cells to make final concentrations of 0, 10, 20, or 80 \\u00b5M. All wells had a final DMSO concentration of 0.5%. Twenty-four hrs after treatment, luciferase activity was assessed using the Steady-Glo luciferase assay with luminescence readout. The luminescence signal was recorded 30 min after cell lysis, and was quantified repeatedly every 30 min for six hrs. As shown in , the luminescent signal was strong and stable for over one and half hrs after adding the luciferase reagent.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0044686.g001Figure 1Development and optimization of an ARE induction assay in AREc32 Cells.(A) The luciferase assay signal stability in the presence of 0, 10, 20, or 80 \\u00b5M tBHQ.(B) The effect of AREc32 cells seeding density on the luciferase assay sensitivity in the presence of 0, 10, 20, or 80 \\u00b5M.

Twenty-four hrs after treatment, luciferase activity was assessed with luminescence readout. The luminescent signal was quantified 30 min after adding the luciferase reagent to the cells. Data is presented as fold increase in luminescence by tBHQ over vehicle control. As shown in , 3,000\\u20133,500 cells\\\/well provided optimal activation of the ARE-luciferase construct by tBHQ.\\n\\nThe effect of DMSO on cell viability and assay sensitivityBecause the compounds are maintained in 100% DMSO, the effect of DMSO on viability and assay sensitivity of AREc32 cells was investigated. Cell viability was unaffected by DMSO below 0.75% (data not shown). To test the effect of DMSO on assay sensitivity, cells were seeded at 3,000 cells\\\/well in a 384-well plate and a mixture of media and DMSO was added to each well to achieve a final DMSO content of 0%\\u201310%. Additionally, 5 \\u00b5L of media with or without tBHQ was added immediately following addition of DMSO. Twenty-four hrs after treatment, luciferase activity was assessed by the luminescence readout. As shown in , the ability of tBHQ to activate the luciferase reporter construct was hindered by DMSO concentration above 1%. To avoid cell stress that may activate undesired molecular pathways, 0.5% DMSO was selected as the maximum tolerable concentration of DMSO in the cell culture medium.\\n\\nDose-response activation of ARE-luciferase reporter construct in AREc32 cells by known Nrf2 activatorsTo validate the ARE-luciferase reporter assay, tBHQ and CDDO-Im, two prototypical Nrf2 activators were tested in the AREc32 cells. Cells were seeded at 3,000 cells\\\/well in a 384-well plate and treated with DMSO vehicle or compound (0\\u2013100 \\u00b5M for tBHQ and 0\\u20132 \\u00b5M for CDDO-Im). Twenty-four hrs after treatment, luciferase activity was assessed by quantifying the luminescent intensity. As shown in , both tBHQ and CDDO-Im increased the luminescence signal in a dose-dependent manner, with over a 70-fold increase in luminescence at 100 \\u00b5M (tBHQ) or 300 nM (CDDO-Im).\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0044686.g002Figure 2Validation of the ARE induction assay using known Nrf2 activators and through pilot screening.(A) Concentration-response curves of tBHQ and CDDO-Im to increase the luminescent signal in AREc32 cells.

Twenty-one compounds (top 1.9%) increased the luminescence signal in a concentration-dependent manner, with the maximum fold-induction value higher or comparable to tBHQ (data not shown).

The fold increase in luminescence, indicative of Nrf2 activation by compounds in AREc32 cells, was plotted against each individual well of the libraries (). The majority of compounds did not activate Nrf2, and were densely packed at the bottom of the scatterplot. Only the top 0.5% hits (238 compounds) increased the luminescence more than 14.4-fold. A histogram summarizing the frequency distribution of the ability of the compounds to increase luminescence over the DMSO control is shown in . The majority of compounds did not activate Nrf2. The top 1% hits (485 compounds) increased the luminescence more than 9-fold, the top 0.5% hits (255 compounds) increased the luminescence more than 14.4-fold, the top 0.25% hits (119 compounds) increased the luminescence more than 20-fold, and the top 0.1% hits (48 compounds) increased the luminescent signal more than 28-fold.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0044686.g003Figure 3Full library screening for Nrf2 activators through ARE induction assay in AREc32 cells.(A) The scatterplot distribution of the screening actives from the ARE library screen was calculated using data from the Chembridge, Prestwick, Microsource, and CMLD library compounds.

Cluster 4 contains 22 structure-related pyridinones, pyridazinones, and pyrimidones, but none had EC50 values lower than 2 \\u00b5M.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0044686.g005Figure 5Chemical scaffolds clustered in the top 247 validated hits from the primary screening.Preliminary hit clustering was based on the EC50 value from the concentration-response curves of the top 240 compounds, and accomplished via the Selector program from Tripos via the Jarvis Patrick routine, using default parameters.\\n\\nInduction of Nqo1 by the top 30 hits from the primary screening in Hepa1c1c7 cellsTo validate the active compounds using a different technique than the ARE-luciferase assay, and to determine the ability of active compounds to induce cytoprotective genes, a secondary screen assay was developed to quantify Nqo1 mRNA in Hepa1c1c7 cells. As shown in , both tBHQ and CDDO-Im increased Nqo1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, with over a 7-fold increase in Nqo1 mRNA with 30 \\u00b5M tBHQ or 100 nM CDDO-Im.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0044686.g006Figure 6Concentration-response curves of known Nrf2 activators and most active compounds from the secondary screening.Concentration-response curves of (A) tBHQ and CDDO-Im, and (B) top 4 compounds from the secondary screening. Hepa1c1c7 cells were treated with compound (0.01\\u20133 \\u00b5M) or DMSO vehicle. 24 hours after treatment, mRNA of Nqo1 was quantified using reverse transcription q-PCR analysis. Fold-increase in Nqo1 mRNA was normalized by cells treated with DMSO vehicle.\\n\\nNineteen compounds with the lowest EC50 values and 14 compounds with the highest maximum increase of luminescence signal from the primary screen were selected for the secondary screen. Three compounds (KU0002640, KU0003452, and KU0013654) were shown to activate Nrf2 at both the lowest EC50 concentrations and the highest maximum increase of luminescence. Thus, 30 compounds were screened in Hepa1c1c7 cells at six concentrations (0\\u20133 \\u00b5M). Among those 30 compounds, 17 of them increased Nqo1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner, and the concentration-response curves of the most effective four compounds are shown in . Specifically, KU002640, which has both the lowest EC50 and highest Nrf2 activation in the primary screen, also increased Nqo1 mRNA the most in the secondary screen.\\n\\nDiscussionThe present study describes the development, implementation, and validation of a high-throughput screen to identify activators of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Using a luciferase-based assay driven by AREs in the promoter region of the luciferase gene, the AREc32 cells provides a rapid and convenient quantification of Nrf2-ARE induction by small molecules, and made large scale-screening for Nrf2 activators possible.\\n\\nIn contrast to many focused-screenings for Nrf2 activators in previous reports, which compared the efficacy and potency of potential Nrf2 activators that are derived from a single chemical scaffold , , , the present study screened 47,000 chemicals with diverse sources and chemical structures. This experimental design increased the chances of identifying novel chemical scaffolds for analogs that could potentially be further developed to have improved potency, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics. The present study summarizes four novel chemical scaffolds that clustered in the top 0.5% hits: (1) diaryl amides and diaryl ureas, (2) oxazoles and thiazoles, (3) pyranones and thiapyranones, and (4) pyridinones and pyridazinones. Among these four chemical clusters, cluster 1 contains the greatest number of the top 0.5% hits (80 hits in cluster 1, 22 hits in cluster 2, 23 hits in cluster 3, and 22 hits in cluster 4), and contains the most number of hits with EC50 values less than 1.4 \\u00b5M (5 hits in cluster 1, 4 hits in cluster 2, and no hits in cluster 3 or cluster 4). Thus, the chemical scaffold of cluster 1 may have the greatest potential for designing chemical analogs and to develop strong Nrf2 activators.\\n\\nThe present study validates the top 0.5% hits (238 compounds) with eleven concentrations in a wide range of concentrations. Thus, the EC50 value for activating Nrf2 of each compound is available, which makes the comparison of the potency of the compounds possible. In addition, the concentration-response assay also generates the highest maximum fold-increase in luminescence, and the ranking of the top hits was modified accordingly. For example, KU0105510 was shown to increase the luminescence 26-fold at 10 \\u00b5M. However, the concentration-response assay shows that KU0105510 can increase the luminescence 119-fold at 18 \\u00b5M, which makes it the second most effective hit in the full library (). Some extremely potent compounds activated Nrf2 at low concentrations, and the activity decreased at higher concentrations. For example, KU0103737 increased the luminescent signal by 18-fold at 10 \\u00b5M. However, the concentration-response assay shows that KU0103737 induced the luminescent signal most at 3.9 \\u00b5M (116-fold), and the induction was blunted at higher concentrations (). Collectively, the concentration-response assay identified extremely effective and potent compounds among the top 0.5% hits.\\n\\nThe concentration-response studies also revealed two distinct patterns in Nrf2-ARE induction. The first battery of hits (example: KU0103737 and KU0105510) increased the luminescent signal markedly (over 110-fold), but the increase was blunted at higher concentrations after reaching the maximum fold-increase. The second battery of hits (example: KU0009102 and KU0003004) increased the luminescence moderately (70-fold), reached a plateau, but also increased the luminescence moderately (60\\u201370 fold) at higher concentrations (6\\u201330 \\u00b5M). Compared with the first battery of hits, the second battery of hits may be more plausible for drug development to have a steady effect over a wide range of drug concentrations.\\n\\nFor luciferase reporter-based assays, one major concern is identifying false active compounds that increase the luminescent signal not through activation of the target, but through stabilization of the luciferase enzyme. Therefore, a counter screen was performed to rule out such false positive hits. The 196 hits from the primary screen were randomly selected and tested for the capability of stabilizing purified firefly luciferase. Among these 196 hits, only 11 hits tested stabilized luciferase enzyme, and thus could be false positives (data not shown).\\n\\nTo investigate whether the validated hits from the primary screen can also induce Nrf2 target genes, a secondary screen was designed to test the ability of the hit compounds to induce Nqo1, the prototypical Nrf2 target gene, in Hepa1c1c7 cells. The results shows that 17 of the 30 compounds increase Nqo1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent manner. The relatively low validation rate may result from four reasons. First, once Nrf2 translocates into the nucleus upon activation, Nrf2 heterodimerizes with other transcription factors (example: small Mafs, c-Jun, and c-Fos) and Nrf2-ARE signaling is affected by these Nrf2-binding transcription factors. Recently, ER\\u03b1 was shown to bind Nrf2 in the nucleus and suppress Nrf2-dependent gene transcription . Thus, the different responses of AREc32 cells and Hepa1c1c7 cells to Nrf2-ARE activation may result from distinct estrogen signaling in these two cell lines (human breast cancer cells versus mouse hepatoma cells). Secondly, the luciferase gene in AREc32 cells contains eight AREs in the promoter region . However, mouse Nqo1 gene is induced through one functional ARE . Thus, the secondary assay may be less sensitive to Nrf2 activators than the primary assay. Lastly, the AREc32 and Hepa1c1c7 cells may have distinct expression of uptake transporters, resulting in different bioavailability of the test compounds.\\n\\nAs for all transcription activation-based assays, neither the primary nor the secondary screening assay provide information about how active compounds activate the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. However, previous reports suggest that these active compounds may activate the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway through multiple mechanisms , as shown in . Some active compounds may disrupt binding of Keap1 to Nrf2, leading to the release of Nrf2, and allowing Nrf2 to translocate to the nucleus . Some active compounds may lead to ubiquitination of Keap1 instead of Nrf2, and facilitate Nrf2 accumulation . Some active compounds may cause an inactivation of the Nrf2 export signal, increasing Nrf2 accumulation in the nucleus . Some active compounds may increase nuclear export of Bach1, which competes with Nrf2 for small Maf binding . Lastly, some active compounds may activate protein kinase cascades (example: MAPK and PI3K) , causing enhanced Nrf2 phosphorylation.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0044686.g007Figure 7Hypothetical modes of action of actives compounds.Four potential mechanisms of action for hit compounds to activate Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Hit compounds can disrupt binding of Keap1 to Nrf2, facilitate Keap1 ubiquitination, inactivate Nrf2 export signaling, or activate protein kinase cascades for Nrf2 phosphorylation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the present study documents the development, implementation, and validation of a high-throughput screen to identify activators of the Keap1-Nrf2-ARE pathway. Eight compounds that are extremely potent and effective in activating Nrf2 were identified.

In order to study the mechanism of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors valproic acid (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) in breast cancer, we generated and validated genomic profiles of drug response using a series of breast cancer cell lines sensitive to each drug. These genomic profiles were then used to model drug response in human breast tumors and show significant correlation between VPA and SAHA response profiles in multiple breast tumor data sets, highlighting their similar mechanism of action. The genes deregulated by VPA and SAHA converge on the cell cycle pathway (Bayes factor 5.21 and 5.94, respectively; P-value 10(-8.6) and 10(-9), respectively). In particular, VPA and SAHA upregulate key cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. In two independent datasets, cancer cells treated with CDK inhibitors have similar gene expression profile changes to the cellular response to HDAC inhibitors. Together, these results led us to hypothesize that VPA and SAHA may interact synergistically with CDK inhibitors such as PD-033299. Experiments show that HDAC and CDK inhibitors have statistically significant synergy in both breast cancer cell lines and primary 3-dimensional cultures of cells from pleural effusions of patients. Therefore, synergistic relationships between HDAC and CDK inhibitors may provide an effective combinatorial regimen for breast cancer. Importantly, these studies provide an example of how genomic analysis of drug-response profiles can be used to design rational drug combinations for cancer treatment.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionMost clinical trials apply single-agent and combinatorial regimens to unselected patients in a random manner, diluting the ability to find successful treatment approaches. This indiscriminate approach has failed to identify curative regimens for many breast cancer patients. In fact, approximately 17% of women with regional breast cancer and 74% of women with metastatic breast cancer will die from their disease within 5 years . Advances using therapies targeted at deregulated pathways have had some successes, but the ability to systematically assess the sensitivity of individual cancers to effective drugs remains to be refined. As with chemotherapy, it is highly likely that combinations of targeted therapies will be critical for effective treatment of breast cancer. Furthermore, as more and more potent single-agent inhibitors are developed, the question becomes how to find useful combinations without resorting to large mechanism-blind clinical trials.\\n\\nOne class of drugs that we do not know appropriate combination regimens for is the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Epigenetic modifications affect a wide range of biological processes and play key roles in development and tumorigenesis , . Among the key chromatin modifying enzymes that affect epigenetic states and gene transcription are the histone deacetylases (HDACs). HDACs have been shown to impact tumor development and progression \\u2013. Overexpression of HDACs have been found in several cancers, including breast, colon, and prostate cancer \\u2013. Drugs that target HDACs have been used in clinical trials for multiple types of solid tumors with some success , . We used gene expression profiling to explore the mechanism of action of HDAC inhibitors in order to rationally combine appropriate therapies.\\n\\nThe effects of HDAC inhibitors include induction of differentiation, arrest in cell cycle in G1 and\\\/or G2, and induction of apoptosis , . Cell cycle arrest at G1\\\/S boundary can be associated with the induction of members of the CIP\\\/KIP family of CDKs inhibitors, such as CDKN1A (p21, WAF\\\/CIP1) and CDKN1C (p57, KIP2). Induction of CDK inhibitors results in p53-independent hypophosphorylation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma gene product, the phosphorylation of which is required for the progression from G1 to S phase in the cell cycle , . In vitro experiments with cell lines have shown that treatment with HDAC inhibitors can increase CDK inhibitor expression, including CDKN1C\\u2013. In breast cancer, tumors do not typically express CDKN1C due to promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation \\u2013. Importantly, low expression of CDKN1C is associated with poor clinical outcome, and the reintroduction of CDKN1C expression in vitro results in suppression of cell transformation, suggesting that CDKN1C may act as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer, .\\n\\nOur overarching goal is to use genomics to rationally identify optimal combination regimens for cancer. In principle, two drugs that produce similar effects can be synergistic when used concurrently. We generate gene expression profiles of drug response to VPA and SAHA, two HDAC inhibitors. In order to capture the diversity of breast cancer, we developed profiles using panels of breast cancer cell lines of various phenotypes that are sensitive to each specific drug profiled. Examination of gene expression changes in response to HDAC inhibitors highlight the critical role of cell cycle regulated genes. These results led to the hypothesis that CDK inhibitors would synergize with HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer. We demonstrate synergy between HDAC inhibitors and CDK inhibitors in breast cancer cell lines and primary patient tumors grown in 3-dimensional culture. Together, these results highlight a novel therapeutic combination rationally designed by genomic analysis.\\n\\nMethodsCell cultures and drugsBreast cancer cell lines HCC1143, HCC38, HCC1806, BT483, BT549, MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-453, SKBR3, and T47D were maintained in culture in RPMI (SIGMA) containing 2 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), 10 mM HEPES (Invitrogen), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen), 4.5 g\\\/L glucose (Invitrogen), and 10 % fetal bovine serum (Sigma). BT474, MDA-MB-361, CAMAI, MCF7, and Hs578t breast cancer cell lines were maintained in culture in DMEM (SIGMA) containing 2 mM L-Glutamine (Invitrogen), 1 mM NEAA (Invitrogen), 1 mM Sodium Pyruvate (Invitrogen), 4.5 g\\\/L glucose (Invitrogen), and 10 % fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Valproic Acid (VPA) (SIGMA) was dissolved in water at stock concentration of 500 mM; suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) (Cayman Chemical) was resuspended in DMSO at stock concentration of 20 mM; PD-0332991 (Selleck) was dissolved in DMSO at stock concentration of 10 mM.\\n\\nGeneration of drug response profiles for HDAC inhibitorsBreast cancer cell lines sensitive to HDAC inhibitors as determined by their EC50 (HCC38, BT483, BT549, BT474, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-435s, MDA-MB-453, SKBR3, ZR75, CAMAI, MCF7, Hs578t, T47D) representing the major breast cancer phenotypes (ER\\u2212\\\/PR\\u2212\\\/ErbB2\\u2212; ER+\\\/ PR+\\\/ ErbB2 +; ER\\u2212\\\/PR\\u2212\\\/ ErbB2+) were seeded in 100 mm plates (NUNC) in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum, at 75% density. After 24 h, VPA or SAHA were added at the final concentration of 5 mM VPA and 1.5 \\u03bcM SAHA. After 6 h the cells were harvested and subjected to RNA purification by RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and 1 \\u03bcg of each sample was later hybridized to Affymetrix U133 microarrays according to the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol. To verify VPA and SAHA efficacy on HDACs activity, a portion of each sample was subjected to histone purification (Active Motif) and resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE. Western blots were hybridized with anti-acetyl-histone H4 (Millipore) antibody to evaluate the histone acetylation status, and the proteins visualized with the ECL Plus Western Blot Detection system (GE Healthcare) (data not shown).\\n\\nMicroarray data were analyzed as described in the . In brief, microarray data were MAS 5.0 normalized, scaled by log base 2, and then quantile normalized. Distance weighted discrimination was used to eliminate differences between the training cell lines and datasets. A Bayesian analysis binary regression model was then used to derive the profiles.. To enable complete reproduction of our results, the input files, output files and the binary regression program used in this study are available at: http:\\\/\\\/io.genetics.utah.edu\\\/files\\\/Pharmacogenomics_synergy\\n\\nWestern blot analysis of CDKN1C expression and activation following HDAC inhibitor treatmentBreast cancer cells were seeded in 100 mm plates in media containing 5% fetal bovine serum, at 75% density. After 24h, 5 mM VPA or 1.5 uM SAHA were added to the media. After 24 and 48h the cells were harvested and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM TRIS (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% SDS) containing 0.1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride(PMSF), and 100\\u03bcM protease inhibitors cocktail (Sigma). After centrifugation at 14000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4\\u00b0C, the protein yield was quantified by Bradford assay (Pierce), and equivalent amounts of protein were resolved on a 10% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. Total CDKN1C and CDKN1A expression was detected by primary antibody to CDKN1C (Cell Signaling), and mouse p21(Amersham).. GAPDH (AbCam) was used as loading control. Western blots were developed with the ECL Plus Western Blot Detection system.\\n\\nStatistical analysisGene Ontology calculations were done using http:\\\/\\\/gather.genome.duke.edu and werw limited to genes significantly deregulated following drug treatment (p value<=0.001 by paired t-test). Bayes factors (the ratio of the posterior probability of associating a particular Gene Ontology category and the given gene list to the probability in a random gene list) and p-values were calculated. In all figures, error bars represent 95% confidence intervals unless otherwise noted. Bliss Interaction Index for dose d1 of drug A and dose d2of drug B was calculated as: \\nI=fd1,A+d2,Bfd1,A+fd2,B-fd1,A\\u00d7fd2,B where fd1,A is the percent inhibition in cell number when treated with drug A at dose d1 and fd2,B is the percent inhibition in cell number when treated with drug B at dose d2. Two drugs are synergistic if the Bliss Interaction Index is greater than 1 and antagonistic if it is less than 1. Each combination was tested in triplicate for 2-D cultures and duplicate for 3-D cultures, and variability of Bliss Interaction Index was confirmed by 2-way ANOVA. For those cell lines with 2-way ANOVA p-values < 0.05, Bonferroni post-testing was performed to compare each dose combination with a triplicate of 1 by a two-sided t-test with alpha=0.05. The p-value for the dose combination with the Bliss Interaction Index furthest from 1 is reported. Graphs and calculations were generated in MATLAB 2009 and Graphpad Prism v4.02.\\n\\nAnalysis of CDK inhibitionGene expression microarray CEL files were downloaded from GEO GSE18552  and GSE15396 . The GSE18552 dataset contains gene expression data from an ovarian cancer cell line (A2780) and a breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) before and after treatment with a variety of CDK inhibitors (CDK-125, CDK-887, and CDK 509). The GSE15396 dataset contains gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a prostate cancer cell line (DU145), and a colon cancer cell line (HCT116) before and after treatment with the CDK inhibitor R547 or DMSO. The CEL files were mas5 normalized, scaled by log base 2, and quantile normalized.\\n\\nAnalysis of synergistic effect of HDAC\\\/CDK inhibitorsBreast cancer cell lines were seeded in 384 well plates (NUNC) in media (DMEM or RPMI) containing 5% fetal bovine serum, at a density to yield 80% confluence in control treated wells at t=96 hours post-treatment (as determined by growth curves) in either triplicate or quadruplicate. After 24 h, VPA, SAHA, and PD-0332991 were added singularly or in combination. The indicated doses were chosen within the average linear range of drug effect: VPA (64 mM to 0.25 mM), SAHA (3 \\u03bcM to 0.05 \\u03bcM), and PD-0332991 (100 \\u03bcM to 0.05 \\u03bcM). A BIOMEK 3000 (Beckamn Coulter) robot was used to seed the cells and dispense the drugs. After 96 h the cells were harvested and CellTiter-Blue Reagent (Promega) was added to test cell viability. After 2 h of incubation at 37\\u00b0C, the fluorescence was recorded (560(20)Ex\\\/590(10)Em) using a Victor3V 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer) plate reader. The Bliss formula was used to calculate synergy (detailed below).\\n\\nBreast cancer pleural effusion collection, growth in 3D cultures, and synergy assaysAfter obtaining informed consent, pleural effusion samples were collected by thoracentesis from breast cancer patients at the University of Utah. Three samples from breast reduction were also collected at the University of Utah as cancer-free controls. Samples were grown in a 24 Well Ultra Low Attachment tissue culture plate (Corning inc.) for 24 hours at 37\\u00b0C, in 5% CO2, with MEGM in order to form organoid structures. Cells density was determined with a hemacytometer (Bright-line). Cells were diluted in media and added to BD MatrigelR Matrix, Growth Factor Reduced (BD Biosciences) for total volume of 80% matrix to media. 30\\u03bcL of the cocktail was seeded into a 96 well half area assay plate (Corning inc.) at a density of 8 x103 organoids\\\/well. After 24h, the drugs were added at a range of dosages determined by our drug response assay: valproic acid (4 mM and 1 mM), SAHA (0.3 uM and 1 uM), and PD-0332991 (1.5 uM and 5 uM). After 96 hours CellTiter-BlueR (Promega) was added to test viability. After 4h of incubation at 37\\u00b0C, the fluorescence was recorded (560(20)Ex\\\/590(10)Em) using a Victor3V 1420 Multilabel Counter (PerkinElmer) plate reader. Synergy was calculated by Bliss formula. The assay was performed in triplicate. At least two wells per experiment were treated with LIVE\\\/DEAD Cell viability assay (Invitrogen) and the images were taken using an Olympus IX81-ZDC DSU with ORCAER camera and Slidebook 5.0 software.\\n\\nResultsGeneration and validation of drug response profilesTo investigate patterns of response to drug treatment in breast cancer samples placed onto microarray, drug response profiles for VPA and SAHA were created using a series of breast cancer cell lines that were sensitive to each drug. Importantly, our series of breast cancer cell lines represents a diversity of breast cancer phenotypes, including estrogen receptor positive and negative cells and HER2 positive cell lines. While other studies have profiled gene expression changes following treatment with these inhibitors, only a couple of cell lines were used, which may not represent the gene expression changes across different tumor subtypes. Sensitivity for each cell line was determined using dose-response analysis on a panel of breast cancer cell lines listed in the Methods section. Cell lines most sensitive to the drug (, dose-response curves highlighted in red) were then included in the generation of the profile. In order to generate the drug response profiles, we treated sensitive cell lines with an HDAC inhibitor (5 mM VPA or 1.5 \\u03bcM SAHA) and collected RNA 6 hours later. Microarray analysis was performed, and the top 100 genes correlating to drug response across all cell lines were identified. Heat maps and leave-one-out cross validation curves for each profile are shown in . As shown, there are distinct sets of genes that reflect response to HDAC inhibitors in common to the sensitive breast cancer cell lines. Further, leave-one-out cross validation shows the robustness and internal consistency of the drug response profiles. Next, profiles were validated by projecting them into samples from the Connectivity map treated with VPA, a public dataset of prostate cancer cells treated with SAHA (GSE9000), and a public dataset of normal ovarian theca cells treated with VPA (GSE 1615)\\u2013. Results show that the VPA and SAHA response profiles generated above can accurately identify drug treatment in external datasets in which cells are treated with the inhibitors ().\\n\\nWe then projected the profiles into two large independent gene expression datasets of primary breast tumors (GSE6532 and GSE5460, 539 tumors total). Across the 539 breast tumors analyzed for drug response, there is significant correlation between VPA and SAHA (). These results highlight the similar mechanisms of action of the two drugs, and their similar response profiles in breast tumors. When breast tumors were sorted by different clinical phenotypes (ER\\u2212\\\/+, HER+\\\/\\u2212, tumor size, and tumor grade), no significant interaction between HDAC inhibitor response and subtype was found, suggesting that response to HDAC inhibitors is independent of these factors ().\\n\\nCDK inhibitors are upregulated in breast cancer cells following treatment with HDAC inhibitorsAs genes involved in the cell cycle are significantly enriched following HDAC inhibitor treatment, we investigated individual cell cycle specific genes deregulated following response to VPA and SAHA that could be targets for potential synergistic therapeutic regimens. For this analysis, we calculated the average change after VPA or SAHA treatment in the eight breast cancer cell lines used in the HDAC inhibitor profiles for all cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) or CDK inhibitor genes. Those genes with highest significant change are shown in . In particular, CDKN1C (p57KIP2) was highly upregulated by both drugs. CDKN1C is a member of the CDKN1 family of CDK inhibitors, which, together with CDKN1A (p21CIP1) orchestrates the G0\\\/G1-M phase transition by regulating cyclin\\\/CDK interactions. The HDAC inhibitor-induced over-expression of CDKN1C is particularly interesting since this CDK inhibitor is not normally expressed in human tumors due to promoter hypermethylation and histone deacetylation \\u2013. Other CDK inhibitors were also upregulated following VPA and SAHA treatment, suggesting a key role for CDK inhibitors in drug response.\\n\\nTo assess whether the upregulation of CDK inhibitor expression seen on microarray corresponded to increased protein levels and activation, we next examined the protein level of CDKN1C and CDKN1A. As shown in , HDAC inhibitor treatment causes increased expression of CDK inhibitor protein levels, with large levels of CDKN1C upregulation. These data suggest that CDK inhibitors may play a crucial role in the HDAC inhibitor-dependent decrease in proliferation observed in breast cancer cells\\n\\nCorrelation of HDAC inhibitor response and CDK inhibitionAs our data suggests that VPA and SAHA function, at least in part, by deregulation of CDK-related pathways, we next tested if HDAC inhibitors and drugs targeting CDKs have similar genomic profiles. To assess the relationship between HDAC inhibition and CDK inhibition, we projected the HDAC inhibitor drug response profiles into two datasets of cells treated with various CDK inhibitors. If there are similar mechanisms of action, we expect the HDAC inhibitor signatures to correlate with drug response in CDK inhibitor treated cells. In particular, cancer cells treated with multiple CDK inhibitors (CDK-509, CDK-887, and CDK-125) have gene expression patterns significantly more similar to both VPA and SAHA than untreated controls (). Similarly, in an independent gene expression dataset, cells treated with the CDK inhibitor R547 have gene expression patterns significantly more similar to both VPA and SAHA when the dose is high (IC90 or greater)(). Interestingly, a similar effect was not seen for normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells (data not shown), suggesting that there may be a cancer-specific effect of HDAC inhibitors on CDK inhibition. Together, these results indicate some overlap in the mechanism of action for VPA, SAHA and CDK inhibitors, and suggest these compounds may be synergistic.\\n\\nTo confirm the relationship between HDAC inhibition and CDK inhibition, we examined the genes significantly (p value<0.001) up or down regulated on average after treatment with HDAC inhibitors VPA and SAHA. Genes that were significantly deregulated following VPA or SAHA treatment were then examined for enrichment of pathways using GATHER (Gene Annotation Tool to Help Explain Relationships, www.gather.duke.edu). The top five gene ontologies significantly enriched in the cells treated with VPA\\\/SAHA are given in . KEGG pathway analysis revealed a significant deregulation of cell cycle related genes for VPA and SAHA (Bayes factor 5.21 and 5.94, respectively, and p value 10\\u22128.6 and 10\\u22129, respectively). Often, synergy between two drugs occurs when they target the same pathway. Therefore, we hypothesized that drugs targeting CDKs would be ideal candidates for combination with VPA\\\/SAHA.\\n\\nHDAC inhibitors synergize with a CDK inhibitor in breast cancer cell linesOur global gene expression analysis strongly suggests that cell cycle regulation and CDK inhibition are important components to cellular response to HDAC inhibitors. From these results, we hypothesized that inhibition of multiple targets in the CDK pathway would synergistically decrease breast cancer cell proliferation. To verify whether the combination of HDAC inhibition and CDK inhibition leads to a synergistic response in breast cancer, we tested the potency of combination therapy with VPA or SAHA and the CDK inhibitor PD-0332991. PD-0332991 targets the CDK4 and CDK6 containing complexes, . For these studies, we chose to use HER2-positive cells (BT474 and MDA-MB-361), ER-positive cells (MCF7 and T47D), and negative for hormone receptors and HER2, i.e., triple-negative, (HCC1806, BT549, HCC1143, HCC38, and MDA-MB-453). All tested cell lines are shown. These cell lines were treated with a range of doses with each drug alone or with a combination CDK inhibitor-HDAC inhibitor regimen.\\n\\nAdditivity occurs when the Bliss Interaction Index equals one, and synergy occurs when the Bliss Interaction Index is greater than one. Using the replicates for each combination of doses and each cell line, we calculated the average Bliss Interaction Index. In order to control for multiple comparisons, we first used 2-way ANOVA to determine if the distribution of Bliss Interaction Index across all doses for each cell line differed significantly additivity, i.e., from a distribution where all the dose combinations had Bliss Interaction Index equal to all ones OneHER2-positive cell line showed signifigant synergy for both SAHA and VPA. ). Both of the ER-positive cell lines showed significant synergy for VPA but not SAHA. All of the triple-negative cell lines showed significant synergy with VPA, but some did not show significant synergy for SAHA. (). Indeed, most cell lines had some drug combination with Bliss Interaction Index greater than 2. The highest synergy was often seen when the VPA dose was ~0.25mM or the SAHA dose was ~0.3mM. These are doses well below the EC50 of these drugs, which is not surprising because showing synergy at doses where most cells are killed is difficult. Importantly, these are clinically achievable serum concentrations of these drugs with few side effects. These results highlight the importance of identifying tumors sensitive to specific drugs and the ability to rationally identify effective synergistic regimens using drug response profiles.\\n\\nHDAC inhibitors synergize with a CDK inhibitor in patient tumors grown in 3D cultureTo further validate the synergistic effect of the two classes of drugs in actual patient tumors, we used short-term, 3-dimensional (3-D) cultures of patient breast tumor samples from pleural effusions. The 3-D culture microenvironment more closely resembles the in vivo cellular microenvironment and provides a more biologically relevant growth setting than standard 2-D microenvironments , . Further, as breast cancer cell lines commonly gain additional genetic variation not found in the primary tumors due to long-term growth in culture, testing drug sensitivity in fresh patient samples that have not been grown in culture may be closer to the clinic.\\n\\nDose response assays in 3-D growth conditions were performed for normal breast tissue from breast reductions and for tumors representing various subtypes of breast cancer shown. Samples were treated at doses expected to be synergistic based on the 2-D culture assays. All samples tested are shown in . Importantly, no synergy was observed in the normal breast samples, showing that this drug regimen specifically targets tumor cells. The average Bliss Interaction Index in the primary tumor samples was 2.2 (CI 1.3\\u20133.2). Synergy was seen in Her2+ samples, triple-negative samples, and the ER-positive sample. Bliss Interaction Index and confidence intervals for the individual samples are shown in . The effect of drug treatment on the tumor organoids was also assessed visually by light microscopy with fluorescent dyes to identify live (green) and dead cells (red) (). Tumor organoids treated with VPA\\\/PD0332991 or SAHA\\\/PD0332991 exhibited reduced structural integrity and increased cellular scatter with increasing concentrations of the drugs. A marked increase in ethidium bromide uptake was observed concomitantly with the loss of organoid integrity, demonstrating a cytotoxic effect of the drugs on the primary tumor organoids. Again, minimal cytotoxicity was seen in the normal breast samples. Together, these results strongly support the synergistic effect of an HDAC inhibitor-CDK inhibitor regimen on aggressive breast tumors and the ability of using gene expression profiles to identify efficacious regimens.\\n\\nDiscussionBreast cancer is the most common female cancer, but despite advances in early detection and systemic treatment approximately 40,000 women in the U.S. per year die of breast cancer . Numerous therapeutic approaches have been used with some success in breast cancer to target hormone responsive breast cancers with estrogen antagonists or aromatase inhibitors  and to target tumors that overexpress the human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) with trastuzumab or lapatinib. Unfortunately, metastatic breast cancer is still an incurable disease, highlighting the need for more effective regimens that selectively interfere with the key cancer cell targets to ensure a more positive clinical outcome.\\n\\nThe recent findings that HDAC inhibitors have anticancer properties in various cancer types have opened new options in the malignancies treatment \\u2013. In clinical trials, VPA has promising activity against breast cancer in combination with anthracyclines or demethylating agents \\u2013. The optimal combinations containing HDAC inhibitors are not known, however. One of the mechanisms behind the anticancer properties of HDAC inhibitors may involve overexpression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, a large family of proteins that regulates cell cycle progression, proliferation, and differentiation.\\n\\nBecause of the success of gene expression profiles in elucidating other aspects of breast cancer biology, including molecular subtypes , we examined gene expression profiles of breast cancer cell lines treated with valproate or SAHA to explore the cellular response to HDAC inhibition. Our analysis shows a marked upregulation of numerous CDK inhibitors in breast tumor cells of diverse phenotypes. The inhibitory effect of the CIP\\\/KIP family affects the kinase activity of pre-activated G1 protein complexes such as cyclin E-CDK2 and cyclinD-CDK4\\\/6. Thus, we hypothesized that dual inhibition of cyclin dependent kinases by epigenetic induction of CDK inhibitor proteins combined with a pharmacologic CDK inhibitor would synergistically affect tumor cell growth. Synergistic combinations of CDK inhibitors with an HDAC inhibitor may facilitate use of these drugs in broader settings, as currently CDK inhibitors have limited use in cancer patients due to relatively high toxicity.\\n\\nThe prospect of HDAC inhibitor\\\/CDK inhibitor combination treatment is extremely attractive if HDAC inhibition can increase cell cycle inhibition and decrease apoptotic threshold, thereby reducing the necessary CDK inhibitor dosage to a more tolerable level. In this context, we analyzed combination therapy of HDAC inhibitors with PD-0332991, a small molecule competitive inhibitor of the ATP-binding site of CDK2, currently in clinical trials as single agents and combined with other targeted agents. Our findings show that in breast cancer cells HDAC inhibitors and CDK inhibitors synergistically affect cell proliferation. Combinations of HDAC inhibitors and CDK inhibitors produced a striking response observed in primary cells from breast cancer patients grown in 3-D system, suggesting an acceptable therapeutic index. It is possible that the synergistic inhibition of cyclin-CDK complex formation due to overexpression of CDKN1C is sufficient to induce a cytotoxic effect in tumor tissue originally lacking of the enzyme. We do not see cytotoxicity in normal breast tissue treated with HDAC\\\/CDK inhibitors; therefore, it is possible that in healthy tissue, where CDKN1C is normally expressed, the additional expression is not sufficient to affect the regulation of the cell cycle progression.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the data presented in our study support the use of gene expression analysis of drug response to uncover effective combination therapeutic regimens in a rational manner. This approach will be particularly important for drugs such as VPA and SAHA, in which the mechanism of action is not well defined. By investigating the genes central to drug response using global gene expression profiling, we can identify key targets for therapeutic selection of combination therapies that may be synergistic. As an example, we generate profiles of drug response for VPA and SAHA, and identify pathways central to drug response. Specifically, the assessment of genes and pathways affected by VPA and SAHA treatment resulting from the microarray analysis suggests a deregulation of CDK inhibitors, leading to the hypothesis that combinational therapeutic treatment HDAC inhibitors with inhibitors of specific CDK may represent a new therapeutic approach to the treatment of breast cancer. We validate the synergistic effects of this combination therapy regimen in both breast cancer cell lines and primary patient tumors grown in 3-dimensional culture. We conclude that additional clinical studies of HDAC inhibitor\\\/CDK inhibitors are warranted. Importantly, we show that analysis of gene expression profiles can identify synergistic drug combinations.\\n\\nSupplementary Material1Supplemental Table 1Predictions of VPA and SAHA response in

The trends in the incidence of such diseases have developed in a timeframe inconsistent with the much slower pace of changes in the human genome, suggesting that environmental factors have shaped these disease patterns. Reports by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics, the World Health Organization, the United Nations Environment Program, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Endocrine Society, indicated that early-life chemical exposure can cause serious adverse effects during susceptible periods of human development that endure into later life. Identification of the environmental chemicals that may induce adverse pregnancy outcomes and adult metabolic diseases is essential.\\n\\nEpidemiological studies have linked environmental chemicals such as bisphenol A, phthalates, perfluoroalkyl acids, and organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) to adverse pregnancy outcomes and adult metabolic diseases. Because human population studies were complicated by the diverse genetic backgrounds of the subjects and their concurrent exposure to numerous chemicals, these studies often yielded heterogeneous results and may not provide direct evidences of causal relationships. As a crucial organ in the regulation of fetal development, the placenta is responsible for secretion of hormones that reprogram maternal physiology and for maternal\\u2013fetal material exchange. Cumulative evidence suggested that placental disorders can induce adverse pregnancy outcomes and, by the \\u201cthrifty phenotype hypothesis,\\u201d permanently alter human metabolism and increase the risk of lifelong metabolic diseases., Placenta develops from trophoblasts to mature placenta during the first trimster of human pregnancy. Placentation is particularly essential because it models the basic pattern of materal\\u2013fetal interaction and gradually promotes maternal adaptation to invasive tissue. However, whether and how a xenobiotic affects human placentation remains unknown, owing to limited access to developing human placenta tissues and absence of practical experimental models.\\n\\nBecause adverse effects assessed using cell lines lack relevance for human health, directly modeling complex human disease and tissue biology using high-throughput assays is desirable, as proposed in the ToxCast program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency., Recently developed human trophoblast organoids displayed near-physiological cellular composition and behavior relative to immature human placenta and allowed dynamic placentation to be observed. Establishing a high-throughput screening model using human trophoblast organoids may be desirable in identifying a chemical that may disrupt human placentation from a wide range of chemicals.\\n\\nHere, we devised a high-throughput immunofluorescence screening assay based on human trophoblast organoids and used it to screen for OPFRs that could inhibit proliferation. OPFRs as substitutes for conventional flame retardants are commonly used in furniture and electronic productions and have been detected in humans worldwide., We used short-term and long-term exposure strategies to investigate the effects of one such chemical, 2-ethylhexyl-diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP), on placentation in trophoblast organoids and the associated molecular mechanisms because EHDPP has been widely detected in both the environment and the human body. Finally, the possible occurrence of disorders in immature and mature placentas and adverse pregnancy outcomes were investigated in mice.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsWe performed model validation, high-throughput screening, and short- and long-term exposure studies and explored the associated mechanisms in organoids. Animal studies were also performed. The experiments and their aims are summarized in .\\n\\nFigure 1.Summary of methods.

Thirty OPFRs for which standards could be obtained commercially were picked from Toxicity Forecaster (ToxCast) list (https:\\\/\\\/comptox.epa.gov\\\/dashboard\\\/chemical-lists\\\/FLAMERETARD). Sixteen OPFRs that were recently identified in the environment were also included in the OPFR list, and their relevant context related to where in the environment they were found is described in Table S2. The stock solution for each OPFR standard (10\\u2009mM) was prepared in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO). Triphenyl-d15 phosphate (TPhP-d15) purchased from C\\\/D\\\/N Isotopes Inc. was used as the internal standard for EHDPP analysis. Other chemicals used in this paper are detailed in Table S3.\\n\\nHuman SamplesHuman villi were collected from five 25- to 40-y-old donors. The age and gestational age of the donors and the karyotypes of the villi are presented in Table S4. All human villi used in this study were attained with written patient-informed consent (PIC) in accordance with the guidelines in the 2000 Declaration of Helsinki. Elective terminations of normal pregnancies at 6\\u20139wk of gestation were performed at Peking University People\\u2019s Hospital under ethical approval from the institution (2018PHB060-01). The presence of a fetal sac, limb buds, and fetal heartbeats in the donors was confirmed by ultrasonography prior to the surgical operation. The villi were separated immediately after the operation and stored in Dulbecco\\u2019s modified Eagle\\u2019s medium (DMEM)-F12 (11330032; Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 50-mL amicrobic centrifuge tubes (430828; Corning, Inc.) at room temperature. The villi were then transformed to organoids within 3 h of collection. Organoids from Donor 1 (Table S4) were used in all experiments, whereas the other organoids were used only to assess the effects of EHDPP on organoid proliferation.\\n\\nOrganoid CultureAccording to the recently reported protocol, trophoblast organoids (Figure S1A\\u2013B) were induced from villi in first trimester placental tissue. Briefly, the villus was digested with 0.25% Trypsin-EDTA (25200056; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and DNase I (M0303S; New England Biolabs, Inc.) and then cultured in trophoblast organoid medium (TOM) for 7\\u201310d (Table S5). The formed organoids were digested for passage using Tryple Express (12604013; Thermo Fisher Scientific). A blood counting chamber (YA0810; Solarbio) was used to count cells in the organoid cell pellets, and the diameter of the organoids was determined using a Leica DMI8 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems) after digestion and resuspension in TOM. Organoids were maintained at 37\\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and were digested at 37\\u00b0C for 5\\u2009min to form small cell pellets (10\\u201350\\u03bcm in diameter). After centrifugation at 600\\u2009rpm for 6\\u2009min, undiluted digested organoids were resuspended in Matrigel (356231; Corning, Inc.). Twenty microliters of Matrigel were added to each well of a 24-well plate, and the plate was incubated at 37\\u00b0C for 10\\u2009min. Subsequently, 500\\u03bcL of TOM was added to culture the organoids.\\n\\nScreening and Toxicity EvaluationFor time- and cost-efficient toxicity screening, we optimized the digestion and culture protocols. In the optimized protocol, the organoids were digested at 37\\u00b0C for 3\\u2009min and then gently pipetted up and down to yield large cell pellets (50\\u03bcm in diameter for >50% of the pellets; \\u201coptimized digestion\\u201d; Figure S1C). To maintain rapid proliferation, the concentrations of CHIR99021, Y27632, and prostaglandin E2 (PG E2) in TOM were increased to 5, 10, and 10\\u03bcM, respectively (Table S2, \\u201cOptimized TOM\\u201d), as these chemicals have been reported to increase proliferation.\\u2013 Undiluted cell pellets were replated onto 96-well plates with 10\\u03bcL Matrigel at a density of 3,000 pellets per well. After a 2-d culture, trophoblast organoids were treated with each chemical from the list of OPFRs (Table S1) at 10,\\u2009000\\u2009nM. The same DMSO concentration (0.1%) used in the exposure groups was used in the control group (n=3). Sytox Green (R37168; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used to evaluate cell survival. In the screening assay, 2-d OPFRs exposure was performed considering both fast screening and toxicity observation. After the organoids were exposed to OPFRs, Sytox Green (dilution: 1:50) was added, followed by incubation at 37\\u00b0C for 30\\u2009min. Thereafter, fluorescence was measured using an ImageXpress Micro Automated High-Content Analysis System (Molecular Devices).\\n\\nThis study used Ki67 to evaluate proliferation of organoids. After exposure to OPFRs for 2d, the organoids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (C2055; Bioss) for 30\\u2009min at room temperature, permeabilized by 0.25% Triton X-100 (CR00576; EBT Systems) for 30\\u2009min at room temperature, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (PM5130; Coolaber) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 60\\u2009min at 37\\u00b0C, and stained with an anti-Ki67 antibody (9449S; dilution: 1:100; Cell Signaling Technology) for 60\\u2009min at 37\\u00b0C and with secondary antibodies (antimouse IgG heavy and light chains, 8890S, dilution: 1:100, Cell Signaling Technology) for 60\\u2009min at 37\\u00b0C. After Ki67 incubation and secondary antibody incubation, the organoids were washed three times with PBS. These steps were followed by automatic imaging and analysis using an ImageXpress Micro High-Content Analysis System (Molecular Devices) to obtain the fluorescence intensity.\\n\\nThe EHDPP concentration of 10,000\\u2009nM has been reported to be the lowest observed effect concentration to disrupt hormone biosynthesis in human choriocarcinoma cell line. Thus, exposure concentration was set at 100\\u201310,000\\u2009nM for obtaining dose-dependent placental-disrupting effects. Organoids were exposed to 100, 1,000, or 10,000\\u2009nM EHDPP on the third day after digestion and were then cultured for an additional 2d, in which the exposure timing was determined similar with screening assay. The same DMSO concentration (0.1%) was used in the exposure groups and the control group (n=3).\\n\\nTo observe the dynamic effects of EHDPP on placentation, organoids were exposed to 100, 1,000, or 10,000\\u2009nM EHDPP on the third day after digestion and were then cultured for an additional 10d following the protocol described in the \\u201cOrganoid Culture\\u201d section. The timing of long-term exposure was set as 10d, which is the longest timing of culture reported previously. The same DMSO concentration (0.1%) was used in the exposure groups and the control group (n=3).\\n\\nQuantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)Trophoblast organoids or animal tissue samples were collected using 500\\u03bcL TransZol Up (ET111-01, Transgen). For RNA extraction, 100\\u03bcL of chloroform (M1024442500; Merck) was added to each sample, and the samples were shaken vigorously and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10\\u2009min at 20\\u00b0C. The resulting top layer was aspirated, and an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol (1.01,040.4008; Merck) was added. The samples were shaken gently and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10\\u2009min at 20\\u00b0C. After removing the supernatant, 700\\u03bcL of 75% ethanol (E801077; Macklin) was added, and the samples were shaken gently and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 5\\u2009min at 20\\u00b0C. The supernatant was removed, and the RNA pellet was dissolved in 30\\u03bcL of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated H2O (W274329; Aladdin). The RNA samples were then quantified using a Nanovue Plus spectrophotometer (GE Healthcare Life Science). We used Oligo dT (3805; Takara), Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus Reverse Transcriptase (639574; Takara), Recombinant RNase Inhibitor (2313Q; Takara), dNTP (4019; Takara), and Random Primers (3802; Takara) for reverse transcription on a S1000 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) with the following program: 40\\u00b0C for 60\\u2009min, 70\\u00b0C for 15\\u2009min, and held at 4\\u00b0C. SYBR Green (QPK-201; Toyobo) was used for real-time fluorescence detection on a StepOnePlus sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) with the following program: 95\\u00b0C for 1\\u2009min and 40 cycles of 95\\u00b0C for 15s and 60\\u00b0C for 45s. Relative gene expression was evaluated by the 2\\u2212\\u0394\\u0394Ct method, as suggested by Applied Biosystems. The primers were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific, and the primer sequences are listed in Table S6.\\n\\nImmunofluorescence of OrganoidsAfter EHDPP exposure, trophoblast organoids were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30\\u2009min, permeabilized by 0.25% Triton X-100 for 30\\u2009min, blocked in 3% BSA in PBS for 60\\u2009min at 37\\u00b0C, and stained with primary antibodies for 60\\u2009min at 37\\u00b0C and secondary antibodies for 60\\u2009min at 37\\u00b0C. After primary and secondary antibody incubation, the organoids were washed three times in PBS. Information regarding the antibodies and 4\\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) is provided in Table S7. Samples were visualized under a Dragonfly High Speed Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope (Oxford Instruments Andor) and were quantified using Fiji software.\\n\\nEnzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA)Estradiol (E2) is not independently synthesized in the placenta because placenta does not biosynthesize its precursor; therefore, it is mainly transported after maternal and fetal synthesis. Thus, the organoid culture medium was supplemented with testosterone (40\\u03bcM) after a 1-d culture to determine the E2 secretion capacity of the organoids. To assess hCG-\\u03b2 and E2 secretion, the collected medium was centrifuged at 12,000\\u2009rpm for 10\\u2009min to remove debris and then stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C. An hCG-\\u03b2 ELISA (48T-QS40792; Qisong Bio.) and E2 ELISA (APH102; Tiosbio) were performed using 50\\u03bcL supernatant and 50\\u03bcL sample dilution buffer. The concentrations of hCG-\\u03b2 and E2 were measured by absorbance at 450\\u2009nm using a microplate reader (SpectraMax i3X; Molecular Devices) following the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol.\\n\\nMitochondrial Stress AssayTrophoblast organoids were cultured in 24-well tissue culture plates (100882; Agilent) at a density of 5,000 cell pellets per well and exposed to EHDPP for 48 h. The sensor cartridge was then hydrated overnight in Seahorse XF Calibrant (100850; Agilent) at 37\\u00b0C in a non-CO2 incubator. Before analysis of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR), cells were reconstituted for 60\\u2009min in an extracellular flux (XF) base medium containing 100\\u2009mM pyruvate, 200\\u2009mM glutamine, and 2.5M\\u2009glucose at pH\\u20097.4. Chemical reagents were used at the following final concentrations: 1\\u03bcM\\u2009oligomycin, 2\\u03bcMcarbonyl cyanide-4 (trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone (FCCP), 0.5\\u03bcM\\u2009antimycin A, and 0.5\\u03bcM\\u2009rotenone.\\n\\nRNA SequencingThe mRNA was extracted from trophoblast organoids or placentas of E19.5 mice using TransZol Up (ET111-01, Transgen) (n=3). Briefly, the placentas were homogenized in tubes containing 500\\u03bcL of TransZol Up using an electric homogenizer. RNA was extracted using chloroform (M1024442500; Merck) and purified using isopropyl alcohol (1.01040.4008; Merck) and 75% ethanol (E801077; Macklin), as detailed in the \\u201cQuantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR)\\u201d section. The RNA quality and concentration were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies). RNA samples with an RNA integrity number >7 were considered to be qualified for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). RNA-seq was performed at Beijing Genomics Institute. RNA samples were enriched for poly A species, and the sequencing libraries were constructed and then sequenced on a BGISEQ-500 platform (BGI). The average fragment size and overall quality were determined using an Agilent 2,100 Bioanalyzer. Each library was sequenced to an approximate depth of 40 million reads. Sequencing data were filtered using SOAPnuke (version 1.5.2; BGI-FlexLab). Sequencing reads were mapped against GRCh38.p12 (human trophoblast organoids) or GRCm38\\\/mm10 (mouse placenta) reference genomes using HISAT2 (version 2.0.4; Lady Hill Department of Bioinformatics) and Bowtie2 (version 2.2.5; Langmead lab at Johns Hopkins University). The gene expression levels in each sample were calculated using RNA-Seq by Expectation-Maximization (version 1.2.8), and differentially expressed genes were identified using DEGseq2 (version 1.34.0; Mike Love). Only protein-coding genes, processed pseudogenes, and lncRNAs were included in the analysis.\\n\\nCell Culture of 293TThe 293T cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection. 293T cells were cultured in DMEM (C11995500 BT; Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS (10099141C; Gibco). 293T cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 at 37\\u00b0C.\\n\\nWestern Blotting AnalysisTrophoblast organoids, cells, and animal tissue samples were collected in cell lysis buffer (9803S; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) with PhosStop (4906837001; Coolaber), and the protein concentrations were measured by BCA protein assay (P0012S; Beyotime). The samples (n=3) were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10\\u2009min at 4\\u00b0C, and the resulting supernatants were retained for subsequent experiments. After adding 5\\u00d7 loading buffer to each sample, the mixtures were then heated to 100\\u00b0C for 5\\u2009min. Samples were loaded at 30\\u03bcL per lane of a polyacrylamide gel. The final protein concentration was 3\\u03bcg\\\/\\u03bcL, and 90\\u03bcg of total protein was run per lane. The proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose (NC) membrane (MH0322; Macklin) and subsequently blocked with 3% BSA in TBST (50\\u2009mM Tris\\u2013HCl at pH 8.0, 150\\u2009mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20) for 60\\u2009min at room temperature. The membrane was then incubated with the primary antibody at 4\\u00b0C for 24 h and then with the secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h. After primary and secondary antibody incubation, the organoids were washed three times with TBST (10\\u2009min each time). To normalize phosphorylated protein levels, the blots that were probed for phosphorylated proteins were stripped to allow the determination of total protein content. The membranes were washed twice with TBST (10\\u2009min each time) and then shaken in stripping buffer (25mM glycine-HCl, pH 2.0; PMC1710125; Perfemiker) and 1% SDS (CS9701-100g; Coolaber) at 100\\u2009rpm for 25\\u2009min at room temperature. The membranes were washed another two times after stripping and were then blocked, incubated with primary and secondary antibodies, and washed following the protocols described above. Antibody information is provided in Table S7.\\n\\nImmunoprecipitationTo evaluate the binding activity of EHDPP to IGF1R, immunoprecipitation was performed using 293T cells. 293T cells were cultured in a 10-cm petri dish at a density of 20,000\\\/cm2 overnight, followed by transfection with pcDNA3.1 IGF1R-BirA(R118G)-hemagglutinin (HA) and pcDNA3.1 GFP-HA plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 Transfection Reagent (11668027, Thermo Fisher Scientific; n=3). The plasmid pcDNA3.1 IGF1R-BirA(R118G)-HA was obtained from Addgene, Inc. The plasmid pcDNA3.1 GFP-HA was constructed by Beijing Genomics Institute based on pcDNA3.1 IGF1R-BirA(R118G)-HA. The sequence of this plasmid is provided in the Supplemental Material (\\u201cSequence of HA-GFP\\u201d section). The transfected cells were exposed to EHDPP at 1,000 or 10,000\\u2009nM for 48h, and the total protein was then collected by cell lysis buffer (9803S; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.). The collected samples were centrifuged at 12,000\\u2009rpm for 10\\u2009min at 4\\u00b0C, and the supernatant was collected for subsequent experiments. A HA-Tag Magnetic immunoprecipitation\\\/co-immunoprecipitation (IP\\\/co-IP) kit (88838; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used in the immunoprecipitation experiment. HA-IGF1R and HA-GFP proteins were captured by immunoprecipitation using anti-HA beads, respectively. The target protein was collected in elution buffer and diluted to 1mL by PBS. After adding TPhP-d15 as an internal standard, ethyl acetate (3mL) was added to extract the EHDPP bound with the protein. The mixtures were then shaken for 20\\u2009min on an orbital shaker, followed by 4,000 rpm centrifugation for 12\\u2009min. Extraction from the residues was repeated twice. The extracted samples were dissolved with 1mL of hexane (Hex). Samples were preconditioned with 6mL of dichloromethane (DCM), 6mL of Hex, and 6mL of Hex\\\/DCM (80:20, v\\\/v). After that, samples were loaded onto Bond Elut NH2 (6mL, 1g) cartridges. After washing with Hex (3mL) and Hex\\\/DCM (1.5mL, 80:20, v\\\/v), DCM (3mL) was used to elute the analytes from the NH2 cartridges. The extracts were evaporated to dryness under high-purity nitrogen. After that, the extracts were redissolved in 100\\u03bcL of methanol (MeOH) for liquid chromatography\\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS\\\/MS) analysis. The LC apparatus was an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The column (C8) was maintained at 40\\u00b0C with a flow rate of 0.3mL\\\/min, and the injection volume was 5\\u03bcL. Methanol (A) and ultrapure water containing 10\\u2009mM ammonium acetate (B) were used as the mobile phases. The mobile phase gradient was increased from 10% to 40% solvent A linearly within 1\\u2009min. Solvent A was then increased to 100% in the next 9\\u2009min and maintained at 100% for 3.5\\u2009min. Finally, the gradient was returned to the initial condition of 10% solvent A for a 6\\u2009min re-equilibration before the next injection. The total run time was 18.5\\u2009min. Mass spectrometry was performed using a TSQ Quantum Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with a Z-Spray ionization source operated in the positive ion mode. The ion transfer tube temperature, vaporizer temperature, sheath gas, aux gas, and spray voltage were 320\\u00b0C, 200\\u00b0C, 40\\u2009Arb, 12\\u2009Arb, and 3,200V, respectively. The recovery of EHDPP was 87.6\\u00b113%. The limit of quantitation (LOQ) was 0.022\\u2009ng\\\/mL, and the final concentrations reported in this study were blank subtracted (0.007\\u00b10.0015\\u2009ng\\\/mL).\\n\\nConcentration Determination of EHDPP in OrganoidsOrganoids were exposed to 1,000\\u2009nM EHDPP on the third day after digestion and were then cultured for an additional 2d, following the protocol described in the \\u201cScreening and Toxicity Evaluation\\u201d section; the blank samples were prepared by DMSO-treated organoids, following the same protocol (n=3). After that, the organoids were digested by Tryple Express, followed by 1,000\\u2009rpm centrifugation for 5\\u2009min at 4\\u00b0C. After removing the supernatant, organoids were freeze-dried and then dissolved and detected, following the protocol described in the \\u201cImmunoprecipitation\\u201d section. The LOQ was 103.0\\u2009ng\\\/g\\u2009dry weight\\u2009(dw), and the final concentrations reported in this study were blank subtracted (73.4\\u00b13.0\\u2009ng\\\/g\\u2009dw).\\n\\nIn Vitro Kinase Activity TestBecause IGF1R is a tyrosine kinase receptor, this study performed in vitro kinase activity test to demonstrate that EHDPP can bind to IGF1R and inhibit its kinase activity in vitro. This study used Z\\u2032-LYTE kinase assay kit-Tyr 1 peptide (PV3190; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and IGF1R recombinant human protein (PV3592; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 150 ng\\\/mL in the test). This study detected the kinase activity of 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM EHDPP and 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100\\u2009nM OSI-906 (positive antagonist of IGF1R), and DMSO was used as the control (n=3). The mix of 2.5\\u03bcL compound, 5\\u03bcL\\u2009kinase\\\/peptide, and 2.5\\u03bcL adenosine triphosphate (ATP) solution was incubated for 60\\u2009min at room temperature. The mix of 2.5\\u03bcL DMSO, 5\\u03bcL\\u2009kinase\\\/peptide, and 2.5\\u03bcL kinase buffer was used as a 100% inhibition control group; the mix of 2.5\\u03bcL DMSO, 5\\u03bcL\\u2009kinase\\\/peptide, and 2.5\\u03bcL ATP solution was used as a 0% inhibition control group; and the mix of 2.5\\u03bcL DMSO, 5\\u03bcL phosphopeptide solution, and 2.5\\u03bcL kinase buffer were used as a 100% phosphorylation control group. After that, 5\\u03bcL development solution was added for 60\\u2009min at room temperature, and then 5\\u03bcL stop reagent was added. The mixes were detected at Ex400, Em445, and Em520, using a microplate reader (SpectraMax i3X; Molecular Devices). The protocol was detailed in https:\\\/\\\/www.thermofisher.cn\\\/order\\\/catalog\\\/product\\\/PV3190?SID=srch-srp-PV3190.\\n\\nAnimal ExperimentsAnimal studies were performed in accordance with the University Guidelines for Animal Experiments and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Peking University (approved No. Urban-HuJY-1). Female 8-wk-old CD-1 mice and male 10-wk-old CD-1 mice from Charles River Laboratories were used in this study. All female mice used in this experiment were acclimated in the housing units for 10 d prior to the experiment and were assigned to each group randomly (n=10 per group). Two female animals were housed to a cage, and the mice were acclimatized to the controlled environment (artificial lighting: 12-h\\\/12-h light\\\/dark photoperiod; temperature: 22\\u00b0\\u00b12\\u00b0C; relative humidity: 40%\\u201360%). After the acclimatization period, EHDPP was dissolved in edible oil (peanut oil; Arawana) and administered to the female mice at 0, 0.4, 2, or 10mg\\\/kg\\\/d by gavage. Edible oil was used as a control. Considering that the substances in pregnant women come not only from exposure during pregnancy but also from the exposure before pregnancy, this study exposed female mice 2 wk before pregnancy. After 2 wk of exposure, the female mice cohabited with the untreated male mice at a ratio of 2:1, and vaginal plug formation was checked the following morning as a marker of successful mating. After fertilization, the female mice were continuously exposed to EHDPP until E19.5, and then the mice were anesthetized by 100mg\\\/kg sodium pentobarbital via intramuscular injection and euthanized via cervical dislocation. The embryos were weighed and dissected, and the dead fetuses and resorption rates were counted. Every E19.5 placenta in this study was from a different dam, which was picked randomly. E19.5 placentas were collected for EHDPP analysis (n=3), immunofluorescence (n=5), western blotting (n=3), and RNA-seq (n=3). The EHDPP concentration was analyzed using LC-MS\\\/MS. Placental samples were freeze-dried and ground into fine powder and spiked with a 1\\u2009ng\\u2009TPHP-d15 internal standard. The details of the extraction and LC-MS\\\/MS methods are described in the \\u201cImmunoprecipitation\\u201d section. The recovery of TPHP-d15 was 58.6% \\u00b1 4%, and the recovery of EHDPP was 60.4%\\u00b113%. The LOQ was 0.169\\u2009ng\\\/g dw. The final concentrations reported in this study are blank subtracted (0.033\\u00b10.014\\u2009ng\\\/g dw). E19.5 fetuses were born by cesarean section, and their body weight (BW) was measured immediately. Resorbed, stillborn, and surviving fetuses were counted, and the implantation number was calculated by adding the number of live births, resorbed fetuses, and stillborn fetuses. In humans, FGR is defined as a birthweight lower than the 10th percentile. By using the definition of human FGR and the weight distribution of control mice, the fetal mice with the weight lower than 1.371g were identified as FGR mice, and then we calculated the corresponding incidence of FGR for each treatment group. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed in 8-wk-old offspring of dams in the control and in the 0.4, 2, 10mg\\\/kg EHDPP exposure groups. Every 10 offspring (5 males and 5 females) of dams were used in this study. These offspring were not exposed to EHDPP after birth. One male and one female offspring without observable defect from a dam were picked for glucose tolerance tests, and the weight of the early groups including 10 offspring have no significant difference. Offspring were fasted for 16 h before the test and were then administered 2g\\\/kg glucose (D5796; Sigma) by gavage. Orbital blood samples (100\\u03bcL) were collected from each offspring at 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90\\u2009min after gavage. Serum was separated by centrifuging blood samples at 4,000\\u2009rpm and 4\\u00b0C for 5\\u2009min, and blood glucose concentration was determined using a glucose testing kit (PS0382; Psaitong).\\n\\nImmunofluorescence of E7.5 EmbryosAfter 2 wk of EHDPP exposure, the female mice were cohabited with the normal male mice at a ratio of 2:1, and vaginal plug formation was checked the following morning as a marker of successful mating. After fertilization, the female mice were continuously exposed to EHDPP until E7.5, and then the mice were anesthetized by sodium pentobarbital via intramuscular injection and euthanized via cervical dislocation (n=5). Every E7.5 embryos in this study were from different dams, which were picked randomly. The embryos were collected for whole-mount immunofluorescence by a previously reported method. E7.5 embryos were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature; permeabilized by 1% Triton X-100 for 8 h at room temperature; blocked in 10% BSA, 5% donkey serum (P05B58S; GPL), and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature; and then incubated with a primary antibody overnight at 4\\u00b0C and with secondary antibodies for 2 h at 37\\u00b0C. Antibody and DAPI information is provided in Table S7. Samples were visualized under a Dragonfly High Speed Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope and quantified using Fiji software.\\n\\nImmunofluorescence of E19.5 PlacentasE19.5 placentas were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 d (n=5). Every E19.5 placenta in this study was from a different dam, which was picked randomly. After paraffin embedding and dewaxing, the placentas were treated with 3% H2O2 (01585853; Adamas) for 15\\u2009min and fixed in EDTA (pH=8) for 3\\u2009min. The placentas were blocked in 3% BSA for 30\\u2009min at room temperature, followed by incubation with a primary antibody overnight at 4\\u00b0C and secondary antibodies for 60\\u2009min at 37\\u00b0C. Antibody information is provided in Table S7. Samples were visualized under a fluorescence microscope (BX51; Olympus) and quantified using Fiji software.\\n\\nStatistical AnalysesGraphPad Prism (version 9.0.0; GraphPad Software) was used to perform all statistical analyses. The unpaired two-tailed Student\\u2019s t-test with or without Welch\\u2019s correction and the chi-square test was used for multiple comparisons; *p<0.05 and **p<0.01 were considered to be statistically significant. All exposure experiments of organoids were performed in triplicates. The screening, ELISA test, mitochondrial stress assay, EHDPP concentration detection, in vitro kinase activity test, and glucose concentration test of OGTT had three technical replicates. Western blotting and qPCR had two technical replicates. RNA-seq had no technical replicate. Each organoid treatment experiment was performed in triplicate. Each immunofluorescence of organoids had five randomly selected microscopic fields. Experiments that involved counting birth weight of fetuses, implanted embryonic numbers, and surviving embryonic numbers were performed twice with n=5 and n=5, and E19.5 placentas were selected randomly from each second experiment, respectively. The exposure experiment of immunofluorescence of E7.5 was performed once with n=5.\\n\\nData AvailabilityThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on request. RNA-Seq data is available in Excel Table S1 and Excel Table S2.\\n\\nResultsTrophoblast Organoid-Based Screening of OPFRs at 10,000\\u2009nMThis study used trophoblast organoids to investigate the toxicity of chemicals in human placentation. We followed an existing protocol to produce the trophoblast organoids (Figure S1A, S1B). This study digested organoids to yield cell pellets (50\\u03bcm in diameter for >50% of pellets; Figure S1C). Over half the pellet cells reached a diameter of approximately 100 and 200\\u03bcm after 2- and 4-d cultures, respectively (), whereas the proliferation of organoids in optimized digestion was 0.85-\\u00b10.06-fold relative to the previous digestion after 2-d culture (Figure S1D). After increasing the concentrations of CHIR99021, Y27632, and PG E2 in TOM (Table S5), the proliferation of organoids in optimized TOM was 1.17\\u00b10.04-fold relative to the previous TOM after 2-d culture (Figure S1E). The trophoblast identity of the newly cultured organoids was verified by the expression of markers, including keratin 7 (KRT7) and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) () and by secretion of E2 and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The concentrations of hCG and E2 in the organoids were 10,227\\u00b1473\\u2009mIU\\\/mL and 25,623.5\\u00b12110.4\\u2009pg\\\/mL, respectively, during 24 h of secretion. This study detected cell proliferation and survival by using Ki67 and Sytox Green, respectively, and then assessed the effects of exposure to 46 existing and emerging OPFRs. Any chemicals that caused more than a 20% reduction in Ki67 expression and did not significantly affect cell survival were picked as positive hits (). Under these criteria, three aryl-OPFRs\\u2014EHDPP, tri-o-cresyl phosphate (o-TCrP), and bis (4-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (B4tBPPP)\\u2014were identified as positive hits (). The numeric data from the screening experiments are listed in Table S8.\\n\\nFigure 2.Trophoblast organoid-based screening of OPFRs at 10,000\\u2009nM.

Cells exposed to EHDPP did not exhibit significantly higher rates of cell death at these concentrations after 2 or 10 d of exposure (Figure S2A,B). After a 2-d EHDPP exposure, Ki67 expression levels in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.89\\u00b10.10, 0.79\\u00b10.10 (p<0.05), and 0.48\\u00b10.13 (p<0.01) times as high, respectively, as the Ki67 expression levels in the control group (). This study tested mitochondrial stress and found that the basic metabolism values in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 2,042.5\\u00b1560.4, 1,344.5\\u00b1380.9 (p<0.05), and 1,269.1\\u00b1252.0\\u2009pmol\\\/min (p<0.05), respectively, which were lower than those in the control group (3,018.1\\u00b1740.3\\u2009pmol\\\/min; ). The respiratory capacity in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups was 2,383.6\\u00b1790.2, 1,643.9\\u00b1655.9 (p<0.05), and 1,528.9\\u00b1383.4\\u2009pmol\\\/min (p<0.05), respectively, which was lower than those of the control group (3,012.2\\u00b1477.8\\u2009pmol\\\/min; ). Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PD) levels in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.84\\u00b10.17, 0.69\\u00b10.19 (p<0.05), and 0.65\\u00b10.20 (p<0.05) times as high, respectively, as those in the control group (Figure S2C,D). Different cell layers of organoids have been further detected, including villous cytotrophoblasts (VCTs), syncytiotrophoblasts (SCTs), and extravillous trophoblast cells (EVTs). TP63 (a specific marker of VCTs) expression levels in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.88\\u00b10.13, 0.65\\u00b10.12 (p<0.05), and 0.58\\u00b10.18 (p<0.05) times as high, respectively, as those in the control group (). Additionally, CD71 (a marker of SCTs) expression levels were determined, but they showed no significant difference between the control and EHDPP exposure groups (p>0.05; Figure S2E, F). In addition, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-G (a marker of EVTs) was not detected (Figure S2G).\\n\\nFigure 3.Measures of short- and long-term toxicity of EHDPP in organoids.

CD71 expression levels after 10 d of treatment with 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM EHDPP were 0.67\\u00b10.04 (p<0.05), 0.55\\u00b10.16 (p<0.05), and 0.51\\u00b10.11 (p<0.05) times as high, respectively, as those in the control group (). In long-term cultures, HLA-G was detected (), and HLA-G expression levels in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.89\\u00b10.21, 0.71\\u00b10.16 (p<0.05), and 0.65\\u00b10.12 (p<0.01) times as high, respectively, as those in the control group (). The concentrations of hCG in the 1,000 and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.83\\u00b10.02 (p<0.01) and 0.78\\u00b10.01 (p<0.05) times as high, respectively, as those in the control group, but no difference was observed between the 100\\u2009nM EHDPP exposure and the control group (p>0.05; ). The concentrations of E2 in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.94\\u00b10.11, 0.79\\u00b10.08 (p<0.01), and 0.72\\u00b10.12 (p<0.01) times as high, respectively, as those in the control group ().\\n\\nIn organoids exposed to 1,000\\u2009nM EHDPP for 2 d, Ki67 expression levels in the organoids derived from the five donors (Donors #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5) were significantly lower than those in the corresponding control group (p<0.05; 0.77\\u00b10.03, 0.75\\u00b10.03, 0.73\\u00b10.04, 0.83\\u00b10.06, and 0.81\\u00b10.04 times as high, respectively, as those in the control group; ).\\n\\nThe average concentration of EHDPP in organoids exposed to 1,000 nM EHDPP for 2 d was 610.9\\u00b1376.4\\u2009ng\\\/g\\u2009dw.\\n\\nMechanism of Placentation DisruptionRNA-seq was used to compare global transcript expression profiles between DMSO- and EHDPP-treated trophoblast organoids. The phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase-protein kinase B (P13K-Akt) signaling pathway was found to be significantly enriched, with a lower Q value of 0.0027 and a greater number of enriched genes than other pathways, based on a Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis (p<0.01) (). We found that the relative phosphorylation levels of Akt\\u2009Ser473 in the 100, 1,000 and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.71\\u00b10.13 (p<0.05), 0.54\\u00b10.29, and 0.65\\u00b10.03 (p<0.01) times as high, respectively, as those of the control group (). We evaluated the levels of phosphorylated insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (p-IGF1R) in organoids exposed to EHDPP for 2 d. The relative levels of p-IGF1R in the 100, 1,000, and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups were 0.67\\u00b10.16 (p<0.05), 0.56\\u00b10.13 (p<0.01), and 0.47\\u00b10.25 (p<0.05) times as high, respectively, as those in the control group (). Because no significant decrease in expression of IGFs was observed in any of the EHDPP exposure groups when compared with the control (Figure S3A,B), this study detected the binding activity of EHDPP to IGF1R. The amount of EHDPP captured by HA-IGF1R in the 1,000 and 10,000\\u2009nM exposure groups was 2.79\\u00b10.90 (p<0.01) and 3.12\\u00b11.78 (p<0.01) times as high, respectively, as those captured by HA-GFP (Figures S3C,4E). A Z\\u2032-LYTE kinase assay was further performed and verified that EHDPP significantly inhibited IGF1R activity with an IC50 value of 249\\u2009nM [95% confidence interval (CI): 110\\u2009nM, 367\\u2009nM] ().\\n\\nFigure 4.Investigating mechanisms of placentation disruption using organoids.

The production of OPFRs is increasing and thus exposure is increasing, especially exposure via indoor dust, due to their widespread application in furniture and electronics and even in food packing materials. OPFRs that have been not adequately tested for human toxicity were and are currently allowed on the market. To model this scenario, we devised a screening model based on human trophoblast organoids with visual readout to screen 46 OPFRs. To evaluate the toxicity of chemicals in a time- and cost-efficient manner, we optimized the original organoid culture method by reducing the digestion level so that the organoids were larger and we increased the concentration of molecules that can promote proliferation. In an approach similar to organoids derived using a previously described protocol, GATA-3 and KRT7, which are markers of trophoblast organoids, and hCG were detected in organoids derived from the optimized protocol described herein. Proliferation is critical to maintain the self-renewal and the normal structure and function of a developing placenta. Once a chemical inhibits the proliferative capacity of a human trophoblast organoid, it hinders the process of trophoblast differentiation, which has the potential to induce a placentation disorder. Among OPFRs, three aryl-OPFRs (EHDPP, o-TCrP, and B4tBPPP) were identified to inhibit the proliferation of human trophoblast organoids.\\n\\nOf the three identified OPFRs, EHDPP has been widely detected in environmental samples, including soil, floor dust, drinking water, and food. Moreover, EHDPP is the only organophosphate ester approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition for use as a fire retardant in food packaging materials. Because EHDPP has been detected in human blood, deciduae, and villi, its effects on pregnancy outcomes require further investigation. Further analysis established that a 2-d exposure to EHDPP significantly inhibited proliferation of organoids, and the combination of these results (lower basic metabolism, respiratory capacity, and PD protein level) together suggested that the tricarboxylic acid cycle was impaired by EHDPP. Proliferating cells in trophoblast organoids require the tricarboxylic acid cycle to maintain an open chromatin state. VCTs are the main proliferating cells in the human placenta, the lower VCT count suggested that the disruption of proliferation by EHDPP may mainly represent the inhibition of VCT proliferation in trophoblast organoids. VCTs differentiate into SCTs and EVTs. No significant difference in SCTs after 2-d EHDPP exposure and the lower number of SCTs after 10-d exposure suggested the exhaustion of VCTs may impact SCTs. Because SCTs secrete hormones, such as E2 and hCG, the low number of SCTs after 10 d of exposure to EHDPP may have led to lower E2 and hCG levels than those in the control group, indicating the dysfunction of trophoblast organoids. The role of EVTs is to anchor the placenta to the uterus and transform the maternal spiral arteries to increase blood flow by invasion, and thus the lower number of EVTs suggested that EHDPP may impair invasion. The similar inhibition of proliferation was also observed in the other four strains of organoids, suggesting that EHDPP may have a specific mechanism that is not only effective in sensitive individual. The concentration of EHDPP after 2-d EHDPP exposure was comparable with that in human villi (873\\u2009ng\\\/g\\u2009dw), showing our results have environmental significance.\\n\\nPlacentation disorder is a complicated and systemic process in mammals, and causative connections between environmental factors and specific targets during placentation are indistinct. Using RNA-seq, the PI3K-Akt pathway was found to be significantly enriched after EHDPP exposure in organoids, with a lower Q value and a greater number of enriched genes than the other pathways based on KEGG analysis. Lower p-Akt (Ser473) levels in the exposure groups than in the control group confirmed the inhibition of Akt in organoids, because the phosphorylation of Ser473 in Akt indicates its full activation. Because Akt regulates cell proliferation in the placenta, the inhibition of proliferation observed in this study may be attributed to the inhibition of Akt. IGF1 and IGF2 are powerful mitogens in the first trimester of pregnancy that act via IGF1R, which regulates the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway in mammals., The inhibition of IGF1R in organoids exposed to EHDPP and the structural disorder of trophoblast organoids exposed to OSI-906 (a specific antagonist of IGF1R) suggested that IGF1R plays a key role in EHDPP-induced structural disorders of trophoblast organoids. The inhibition of IGF1R activity may result from low expression levels of IGFs or the inhibition of the intracellular kinase domain of IGF1R., We found that EHDPP binds to IGF1R and inhibits its kinase activity in vitro. Although the IC50 value of EHDPP was higher than that of OSI-906, the strong IGF1R-antigonistic activity of EHDPP was unexpected, as it is an industrial chemical that was not designed as a drug. Because no significant down-regulation in IGF1 or IGF2 expression levels were observed in organoids, EHDPP may antagonize IGF1R activity by directly binding to IGF1R, leading to the placentation disorder in human trophoblast organoids. Additionally, organoids exposed to EHDPP actually showed higher levels of IGF2, which might be feedback regulation because the IGF1R of high activity is crucial in human placentation. However, we cannot fully exclude other latent pathways.\\n\\nExtending these results to similar susceptibility in\\u00a0vivo, mice exposed to EHDPP were also found to exhibit structure disorder and impaired aerobic respiration in the placenta. Late gastrulation (E7.5) is a critical stage in placentation in mice. Cdx2 is a marker of extra-embryonic ectoderm in E7.5 mouse fetuses and controls the proliferation and differentiation of extra-embryonic ectoderm., The lower Cdx2 and Ki67 expressions in placentas of mice exposed to EHDPP than in the control suggested that EHDPP inhibited proliferation and disrupted extra-embryonic ectoderm in mice. Extra-embryonic ectoderm in the immature placenta can differentiate to spongiotrophoblast (SP) and trophoblast giant cells (TGC) in mice. SPs were identified by TPBPA and TFAP2C expression and TGCs were identified by HAND1 and TFAP2C expression in the placentas of E19.5 mice. Lower TPBPA, TFAP2C, and HAND1 levels observed in the exposure groups in comparison with the control group suggested that the SPs and TGCs were disrupted by EHDPP. Because SPs and TGCs secrete hormones and cytokines and exchange materials between the maternal bloodstream and the fetus, EHDPP may affect the function of mature placentas in mice. The lower levels of p-IGF1R protein and aerobic respiration disorder observed in E19.5 placentas suggested that similar mechanism in exposure to EHDPP in trophoblast organoids occurred in\\u00a0vivo. In EHDPP exposure groups, we observed implantation failure, stillbirth, FGR of fetuses, and impaired glucose tolerance in adulthood after birth. These outcomes are regulated by many developmental processes during pregnancy in humans and mice, such as maternal endocrine factors and deficient spiral artery remodeling of the placenta and could not be fully evaluated in this study. Adverse pregnancy outcomes such as stillbirth, implantation failure, and FGR may have placental origins, and some studies have found that adult metabolic disorders may be influenced by placental insufficiency., EHDPP-induced placentation disorder provided a possible explanation for the occurrences of these pathological phenomena. The EHDPP concentration detected in placentas from the group of mice exposed to the highest concentration was lower than the median EHDPP concentration in human deciduae (5.96\\u2009ng\\\/g of dw) and chorionic villi (13.6\\u2009ng\\\/g of dw). Thus, adverse pregnancy outcomes and impaired glucose tolerance in offspring may occur at physiological human concentrations of EHDPP, posing notable risks to gestation and of lifelong metabolic disease in humans. Although the association of EHDPP with these diseases in humans is unclear, epidemiological studies have associated a common metabolite of several aryl-OPFRs including EHDPP with low birth weight and decreased success of fertilization, implantation, and clinical pregnancy. The results of this study suggest a causal relationship between EHDPP exposure and adverse pregnancy outcomes in mice, as supported by primary trophoblast organoid culture data.\\n\\nIn summary, the present study clarified the adverse effects of a commonly used flame retardant EHDPP on human placentation by devising a model based on human trophoblast organoids. The adverse effects of EHDPP on placentation were demonstrated in mice, where it induced fetal growth restriction, implantation failure, stillbirth, and impaired glucose tolerance at physiological human concentrations. Human pregnancy is a long-term life process. Our study may provide prospective and mechanistic insights into the potential correlations between early-life exposure to EHDPP and adverse pregnancy outcomes in humans and a potential approach to high-throughput screen these chemicals in future chemical management. A limitation of this paper is that all structural disorders and dysfunctions induced by EHDPP were observed in the same strain of organoids from one donor, whereas there are interindividual differences, such as the difference in the epigenetic modification level of trophoblast organoids, which may be influenced by various factors, including fetal sex, karyotype, gestational age, and even the maternal health. This study could not give more information about interindividual differences in toxicity of EHDPP exposure because relatively large samples are required but difficult to obtain. However, this toxicity model based on human trophoblast organoids may be helpful to fill the gap in how interindividual differences play their roles in early-life exposure to contamination, and such knowledge may benefit sensitive individuals in the future.\\n\\nSupplementary MaterialClick here for additional data file.\\n\\nClick here for additional data file.\\n\\nClick here for additional data

Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is an essential growth factor that is involved in tissue repair and pulmonary fibrogenesis. In the present study, the role of CTGF was examined in a rat model of pulmonary fibrosis induced by PQ poisoning. Histological examination revealed interstitial edema and extensive cellular thickening of interalveolar septa at the early stages of poisoning. At 2 weeks after PQ administration, lung tissue sections exhibited a marked thickening of the alveolar walls with an accumulation of interstitial cells with a fibroblastic appearance. Masson's trichrome staining revealed a patchy distribution of collagen deposition, indicating pulmonary fibrogenesis. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining of tissue samples demonstrated that CTGF expression was significantly upregulated in the PQ-treated group. Similarly, PQ treatment of MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cells caused an increase in CTGF in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, the addition of CTGF to MRC-5 cells triggered cellular proliferation and migration. In addition, CTGF induced the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, as was evident from increased expression of \\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\\u03b1-SMA) and collagen. These findings demonstrate that PQ causes increased CTGF expression, which triggers proliferation, migration and differentiation of lung fibroblasts. Therefore, CTGF may be important in PQ-induced pulmonary fibrogenesis, rendering this growth factor a potential pharmacological target for reducing lung injury.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionParaquat dichloride (1,1\\u2032-dimethyl-4,4\\u2032-bipyridinium dichloride; methyl viologen; PQ) is an effective and widely used herbicide that can cause pulmonary fibrosis (,). Previous studies have demonstrated that the lungs are one of the primary target organs for PQ-induced toxicity in humans and animals (,). The acute toxic effects of PQ, including pulmonary edema and hypoxia, lead to irreversible pulmonary fibrosis. Notably, 1,000s of mortalities due to intentional or accidental ingestion of PQ have been reported (,). Although certain drugs, including glucocorticoids, antioxidants and cytotoxic drugs, can mitigate toxicity (\\u2013), the treatment of acute PQ poisoning is often poor and mortality rates remain high (,). Since an effective PQ antidote has yet to be identified, studies on the molecular mechanisms of PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis are critical for improving treatment and reducing mortality.\\n\\nConnective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a cysteine-rich extracellular matrix-associated heparin-binding protein that belongs to the CCN family (,). CTGF is widely expressed in numerous tissues at low levels, however, is markedly upregulated in fibrotic and cancerous tissue (). CTGF regulates various biological processes associated with fibro-genesis, including cellular adhesion, proliferation, migration, differentiation, extracellular matrix (ECM) production (\\u2013) and angiogenesis (). In particular, CTGF has been found to promote deposition of several ECM proteins, including collagen, fibronectin and tenascin C (,). Aberrant ECM production by lung fibroblasts has been associated with fibrosis in several models of pulmonary injury (,). ECM production could further be stimulated as a consequence of lung fibroblast proliferation, migration and differentiation into myofibroblasts (). Accordingly, CTGF has been demonstrated to affect various cell types involved in the fibrogenic process, including type II alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells and lung fibroblasts ().\\n\\nAlthough CTGF has been demonstrated to be important in pulmonary fibrosis induced by bleomycin and hyperoxia (,), an association between this growth factor and PQ-induced lung injury has not been established. In particular, the effect of CTGF on ECM production, cellular proliferation, migration and myofibroblast differentiation in association with PQ poisoning remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of PQ on CTGF expression and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsEthics statementAll animals were handled in accordance with guidelines approved by the Experimentation Ethics Review Committee of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). The rats were fed with commercial rat chow, provided with water ad libitum and kept on a 12:12 h light-dark cycle.\\n\\nCell cultureMRC-5 lung fibroblasts (human lung fibroblasts; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA; cat. no. CCL 171) were cultured in high Dulbecco\\u2019s modified Eagle\\u2019s medium (DMEM; HyClone Laboratories, Inc., Logan, UT, USA) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) supplemented with 1% L-glutamine and 1% penicillin\\\/streptomycin solution. Cells were incubated at 37\\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and routinely passaged upon reaching 80% confluency, using 0.25% trypsin and a 1:3 cell dilution for each passage.\\n\\nCell viabilityThe viability of lung fibroblasts was evaluated using a Cell Counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Dojindo Laboratories, Kumamoto, Japan) assay. Cells were plated in 6-well plates at a density of 2\\u00d7106 cells\\\/ml for 12 h and treated with various concentrations of CTGF (50\\u2013200 ng\\\/ml; PeproTech, Inc., Rocky Hill, NJ, USA) for 24, 48 or 72 h. The cells were then transferred into a 96-well culture plate (n=8) at a density of 2\\u00d7104 cells\\\/100 \\u03bcl\\\/well for 12 h. The culture medium was removed and 100 \\u03bcl of serum-free medium containing 10 \\u03bcl of CCK-8 solution was added to each well. After a 4 h incubation period, the absorbance was measured at an optical density (OD) of 450 nm using a multi-detection microplate reader (VersaMax; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA).\\n\\nCell migrationA double-chamber system was used to perform a transwell migration assay to determine the migration ability of lung fibroblasts. Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate with serum-free medium at a density of 4\\u00d7104 cells\\\/per upper chamber. Culture medium (1 ml) with 10% FBS containing various concentrations of CTGF (50\\u2013200 ng\\\/ml) was simultaneously added to the lower chamber. The upper and lower chambers were separated by a permeable polycarbonate membrane with a pore size of 8 \\u03bcm. The cells were permitted to migrate to the lower chamber for 24 h. Following this incubation period, cells that had entered the lower surface of the filter membrane were fixed with a cold solution of 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min. Cells that remained in the upper surface were gently scraped off with a cotton swab. A total of 10 different fields of view from each membrane were randomly selected and captured using a photomicroscope (BX51; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cell migration was quantified by counting the number of migrated cells. Experiments were performed three times in duplicate.\\n\\nAnimal groups and experimental protocolA total of 48 adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats weighing 200\\u2013250 g were purchased from the Animal Center of Nanjing University (Nanjing, China). The SD rats were randomly divided into two groups (n=24 for each group). The experimental group received a single intraperitoneal injection of PQ (30 mg\\\/kg), while the control group received an equivalent volume of sterile saline. The rats were then sacrificed by cervical dislocation after 7, 14 and 28 days.\\n\\nHistological analysisFollowing sacrificing the animals, the lungs were removed and the left lung was fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 16 h. The tissue samples were then processed using graded alcohol, xylene and paraffin and blocked in paraffin. The paraffin-embedded sections (5 \\u03bcm thick) were stained using a hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) kit (Biyuntian, Inc., Nantong, China) and a Masson\\u2019s trichrome staining kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China), according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. The slides with H&E staining were examined using light microscopy (Eclipse TE2000-S; Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan) and images were captured to determine the integrity of the tissue. The severity of pulmonary fibrosis in the lung sections stained for collagen with Masson\\u2019s trichrome stain was determined by a histopathologist who was blinded to the protocol design.\\n\\nImmunohistochemical stainingFormalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded skin sections were stained with rabbit polyclonal anti-CTGF antibodies (cat. no. ab6992; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA). Following transferal through a graded series of alcohol and xylene, lung tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and sectioned (5 \\u03bcm). The sample sections were mounted onto poly-L-lysine-coated slides and processed for immunohistochemical analysis, according to a similar procedure as previously reported (). Briefly, sections were incubated overnight at room temperature with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at 37\\u00b0C for blockade of non-specific binding sites and then incubated overnight at 4\\u00b0C with the primary antibody targeting CTGF (1:200 dilution). Specificity of the antibody was examined using normal rabbit serum instead of the primary antibody. The slides were then incubated with a secondary biotinylated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:200 dilution; cat. no. BA1003; Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Ltd., Wuhan, China) for 30 min at 37\\u00b0C. Following rinsing, the slides were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and then washed with deionized water. The samples were then exposed to 3,3\\u2032-diaminobenzidine substrate solution for 10 min, coun-terstained with hematoxylin and mounted with coverslips. Images were captured on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-S microscope (Nikon Corporation). A brown reaction product was considered a positive result.\\n\\nImmunofluorescenceTo evaluate the effect of CTGF on myofibroblast differentiation of human lung fibroblasts, MRC-5 lung fibroblasts were treated with 100 ng\\\/ml CTGF (PeproTech, Inc.) for 3 days. Immunofluorescence staining was performed as previously described (). Briefly, MRC-5 cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min. The cells were then incubated with PBS containing 2% BSA for 1 h at 37\\u00b0C to block unspecific binding sites. The fixed cells were then incubated with the following primary antibodies: Rabbit polyclonal anti-\\u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\\u03b1-SMA; 1:200 dilution; cat. no. ab5694) and rabbit polyclonal anti-collagen I (1:200 dilution; cat. no. ab34710; Abcam, Inc., Cambridge, MA, USA) at 4\\u00b0C for 16 h. Following three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with a secondary antibody (1:400 dilution; goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 or 488; Invitrogen Life Science, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) in 2% BSA for 1 h at 37\\u00b0C in the dark. Nuclear staining was performed using 5 mg\\\/ml 4\\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Biyuntian, Inc.). Cells were visualized using a confocal fluorescence microscope (Fluoview FV10i; Olympus).\\n\\nWestern blot analysisIn order to investigate the effects of PQ on protein levels of CTGF, MRC-5 cells were treated with various concentrations of PQ (50\\u2013500 \\u03bcM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) for 72 h. Protein samples were obtained from cultured cells and animals (right lung, n=8) treated with PQ. Western blot analysis of protein lysates was performed as previously described (). Briefly, cells and lung tissues were lysed in ice-cold RIPA extraction buffer (150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.1% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) for 30 min. The whole lysates were then centrifuged at 12,000 \\u00d7 g for 30 min and the protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using a bicinchoninic acid assay (Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Ltd.). The protein samples were boiled for 10 min and 20 \\u03bcl aliquots were then subjected to 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The protein bands were electrophoretically transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, which was incubated in blocking buffer (1X PBS, 0.1% Tween-20, 1% BSA and 5% non-fat milk) for 1 h at 37\\u00b0C. The membrane was then exposed to primary antibodies (at a 1:3,000 dilution) against rabbit \\u03b1-SMA, rabbit collagen I and mouse \\u03b2-actin (Abcam, Inc.) in blocking buffer overnight at 4\\u00b0C. Following three washes in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20, the membrane was incubated with the secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit\\\/mouse IgG; Wuhan Boster Biological Technology, Ltd.) at 37\\u00b0C for 1 h. Visualization of immunoreactive protein bands was performed with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ, USA) using an Odyssey Scanning System (LI-COR, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA).\\n\\nHydroxyproline (HP) contentThe quantity of collagen in the lung tissue was determined by analysis of HP content according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions of the detection kit (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute). The absorbance was measured at 550 nm and the HP content was determined using a standard curve (0\\u2013100 mg\\\/ml).\\n\\nStatistical analysisData are expressed as the mean \\u00b1 standard deviation. Differences among groups were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 18.0 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago IL, USA). P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference.\\n\\nResultsPQ-induced lung injury and pulmonary fibrosisAfter PQ administration for 7, 14 and 28 days, rats were sacrificed and the lungs were collected. As shown in , the weight of the lungs increased in response to PQ administration, indicating the presence of pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis. In addition, the macroscopic appearance of the lungs was fibrotic (). These results suggest that PQ is able to induce lung injury, inflammation and fibrosis in this rat model.\\n\\nHistopathological analyses of rat lungs treated with PQTo investigate the effects of PQ on lung tissue, serial lung sections from PQ-treated rats (7, 14 and 28 days after PQ administration) were stained with H&E or Masson\\u2019s trichrome and examined using a light microscope. Representative histological sections from lungs of rats in each experimental group are shown in . Lung tissues in the control group appeared histologically normal, showing no signs of inflammation or epithelial damage. By contrast, histopathological examination of the lung tissue following PQ administration revealed alterations in the lung structure. After 7 days, the lungs exhibited marked alterations in tissue structure, exhibiting signs of acute injury with interstitial edema and widespread inflammatory cell infiltration in the alveolar space and septum. In addition, an infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells, fibroblast proliferation, extensive cellular thickening and fibrosis was evident after 14 days. Similarly, at day 28, H&E staining indicated thickened alveolar walls and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. Masson\\u2019s trichrome staining revealed that collagen deposition (blue staining) in the PQ group was increased compared with the control group (). In conclusion, histological examination demonstrated that PQ administration induced lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis.\\n\\nHP content in the lungs following PQ administrationIn order to evaluate collagen deposition in the lung tissues, the HP content was determined 7, 14 and 28 days after PQ administration. As shown in , PQ caused a statistically significant (P<0.05) increase in the amount of HP at all time points. On day 28, the HP content in the PQ group was more than three times higher than in the control group. The results of HP quantification were consistent with the histopathological results.\\n\\nPQ induces expression of CTGF in lung tissues and lung fibroblastsImmunohistochemical staining was used to detect the expression of CTGF in lung tissue. As shown in , the CTGF expression was significantly increased 28 days after PQ administration (P<0.01). Western blot analysis was also performed to confirm that the CTGF expression was enhanced in response to PQ. As shown in , PQ-induced a time-dependent increase in CTGF protein levels. Furthermore, western blot analysis was performed using MRC-5 cell lysates to evaluate whether the same trend could be observed in vitro. Following exposure to various concentrations of PQ (50\\u2013500 \\u03bcM), the results indicated that the cells exhibited significantly higher levels of CTGF protein (P<0.01; ). The results suggest that PQ-induced CTGF expression may contribute to pulmonary fibrogenesis.\\n\\nCTGF promotes the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblastsThe effect of CTGF on the proliferation and migration of lung fibroblasts was evaluated, as these biological processes are important in pulmonary fibrogenesis. As shown in , the cell viability was significantly increased in response to CTGF (P<0.01). The data indicate that CTGF promotes cell proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. As shown in , the results from the transwell migration assay reveal that CTGF improves lung fibroblast migration in a statistically significant manner (P<0.01). In particular, 200 ng\\\/ml of CTGF caused a 3.6-fold increase in cell migratory capacity. These results highlight the possibility that CTGF is able to mediate PQ-induced pulmonary fibrogenesis.\\n\\nCTGF induces myofibroblast differentiation of lung fibroblastsTo further investigate the role of CTGF in pulmonary fibrogenesis, the differentiation of lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts was examined. MRC-5 cells were incubated with 100 ng\\\/ml of CTGF for 3 days. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis were used to measure expression levels of \\u03b1-SMA and collagen I, which are myofibrolast differentiation markers. As shown in , immunofluorescence staining indicated that \\u03b1-SMA (stained green) and collagen I (stained red) protein expression was increased in the CTGF-induced group, as compared with the control group. In addition, as shown in , western blotting demonstrated that CTGF induced a pronounced increase in the protein expression levels of \\u03b1-SMA and collagen I, indicating the differentiation of lung fibroblasts into myofibroblasts. This differentiation process has previously been associated with lung fibrosis ().\\n\\nDiscussionPQ has previously been found to cause acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis with interstitial collagen deposition, which leads to reduced functional capacity (). PQ poisoning is a severe health problem, as numerous human mortalities have occurred as a consequence of PQ ingestion (,). The lung is the major target organ for this toxic agent, as alveoli type II epithelial cells absorb PQ through an active polyamine uptake process (\\u2013). PQ can accumulate in lung tissue and reach peak plasma concentrations within 2 h after ingestion (). Notably, the concentration of PQ in the lung parenchyma can be 10\\u201320 times higher than that in the plasma (). The signaling pathways that lead to PQ-induced pulmonary fibrosis remain to be elucidated. Previous studies have focused on clarifying the molecular mechanisms of PQ poisoning to determine useful molecular targets for developing therapeutic strategies. The present study examined the role of CTGF in PQ-induced collagen production and myofibroblast differentiation of human lung fibroblasts.\\n\\nCTGF is a downstream cooperative mediator of the transforming growth factor-\\u03b2 signaling pathway and is widely expressed in numerous tissues at low physiological levels. However, this growth factor is markedly upregulated at the pathological sites of numerous animal models of human disease, including pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, skin fibrosis, cancer and various types of malignancy (,,). In particular, increased levels of CTGF have previously been reported in patients with severe pulmonary fibrosis and animal models of pulmonary fibrosis (). In the present study, PQ exposure caused alterations in lung architecture, which was evident from interstitial edema, extensive cellular thickening of interalveolar septa, increased interstitial cells with a fibroblastic appearance and excessive collagen deposition. Concurrently, it was found that PQ exposure induces CTGF expression in vitro and in vivo. A previous in vitro study also indicated that CTGF can exert an effect on a number of cell types, thereby promoting biological processes associated with fibrogenesis, including cell proliferation, migration and ECM production (). The present study demonstrated that CTGF can induce the proliferation and migration of MRC-5 lung fibroblasts. Therefore, it is likely that CTGF is a mediator of PQ-induced pulmonary fibrogenesis.\\n\\nAccumulating evidence suggests that the overexpression of collagen and \\u03b1-SMA in lung fibrotic lesions is associated with fibrotic lung disease (). Collagen is the major ECM component of the lungs and increases at the early stages of acute lung injury, affecting respiratory mechanics. Myofibroblasts that originate from the differentiation of lung fibroblasts exhibit morphological and biochemical characteristics of lung fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells, which have been considered the main source of ECM within the impaired lungs of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (,). The results from the present study are supported by a previous study demonstrating that CTGF knockdown animals have a reduced pathogenic fibrotic response (). The mechanism responsible for protection against fibrosis in CTGF knockdown cells was found to be reduced collagen synthesis (). In the present study, the results indicate that PQ exposure causes increased levels of collagen and CTGF, in a time-dependent manner. Immunofluorescent staining and western blot analysis reveal that lung fibroblasts treated with CTGF have increased expression of collagen and \\u03b1-SMA. This observation suggests that CTGF can induce myofibroblast differentiation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, our observations imply that PQ-induced overexpression of CTGF may be responsible for pulmonary fibrosis, through promoting the proliferation, migration and myofibroblast differentiation of lung fibroblasts. The present study supports the theory that pharmacological inhibition of CTGF is a feasible strategy to reduce the magnitude of pulmonary fibrosis induced by PQ.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"Paraquat\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"CCN2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"Paraquat results in increased expression of CCN2 protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Paraquat\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"CCN2\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"Paraquat results in increased expression of CCN2 protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"}]"}]}

Death of these patients results from uncontrolled metastatic disease, including liver, lymph nodes, or peritoneum metastases. Inflammation is considered a risk factor for many common malignancies including cancers of the lung , breast , and colorectum . Chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) such as chronic ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease is associated with increased incidence of colorectal carcinoma as compared with the normal population \\u2013. The link between inflammation and colorectal carcinoma offers the possibility of identifying novel ways to prevent cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms whereby chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer remain elusive.\\n\\nDifferent products of enterobacteriaceae and especially their lipopolysaccharides (LPS) may also contribute to perpetuation of the chronic colorectal inflammation . Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), which is responsible for recognizing Gram-negative bacterial LPS, is upregulated and overexpressed in patients with IBD or colorectal carcinoma \\u2013 whereas TLR4 normally is expressed at low level in the intestinal mucosa , , . TLR4 is known to be implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic gastrointestinal disorders such as celiac disease  and IBD . Additionally, TLR4 elicits appropriate immune activation in various types of cancer such as lung, ovary, stomach and colorectum. LPS binding induces the formation of a symmetric M-shaped TLR4-MD-2-LPS multimer composed of two copies of the complex to activate pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, which could induce expression of some chemoattractant receptors \\u2013. Nevertheless, little else is known of the involvement of TLR4 in the progression of colorectal carcinoma.\\n\\nInitiation and progression of malignancies is the result of a series of complex processes that depend upon multiple and interactive factors . Clinical and experimental studies indicate that CXC chemokines enhance immunity to tumor-associated antigens. However, they may also promote angiogenesis, proliferation and tumor cell invasion, such as the CXCL12 (SDF-1)\\\/CXCR4 axis . Recently, CXCR7 was identified as a second receptor for CXCL12. It was described to be present on the surface of many tumor cell types and on activated endothelial cells. Generally, but depending on cell type, CXCR7 was reported to be either a non-signaling receptor (decoy receptor) or a signaling receptor. However, the function and regulatory mechanisms of CXCR4\\\/CXCR7 and the relationship between TLR4-MD-2 and CXCR4\\\/CXCR7 in colorectal carcinoma is still unknown.\\n\\nOur studies suggest that exposure to LPS elevates CXCR7 expression in a colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines expressing TLR4\\\/MD-2. Meanwhile, CXCR7\\\/CXCL12 modulates tumor cell proliferation and migration. However, exposure of SW480 and Colo 205 cells to LPS had no effect on CXCR4 expression. Exposure of HT-29 cells with expression of only TLR4 to LPS had no effect on CXCR7 or CXCR4 expression. Furthermore, we found that combined expression of all three markers (TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7) more strongly correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis than did each of the three markers alone. Thus, recombination of TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 may prove to be valuable prognostic markers for predicting the proliferation and metastatic ability of colorectal carcinoma cells. An understanding of the relationships between microbial signals and colorectal carcinoma tissue might provide further clues for the development of new therapeutic strategies.\\n\\nResultsExposure of TLR4 to LPS elevates CXCR7 expression in colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell linesmRNA of colorectal carcinoma cell lines encoding TLR4 with its co-molecules, MD-2 were determined using RT-PCR. The analysis of RT-PCR products showed that TLR4 and MD-2 were constitutively expressed in 4 out of 8 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines, including Colo 205, RKO, SW480 and SW620, whereas TLR4 and MD-2 were present respectively in only two cell lines such as DLD-1 and HCT-29 (). We tested two cell lines(SW480 and Colo 205) with expression of both TLR4 and MD-2 and one(HT-29) with expression of only TLR4.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0027399.g001Figure 1LPS-TLR4-MD-2 induced CXCR7 expression alteration in colorectal carcinoma cell line.A, Reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis (TLR4 and MD-2) on RNA isolated from 8 human colorectal carcinoma cell lines. B, LPS induced time- and dose-dependent CXCR7 and CXCR4 protein expression alterations. SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines were incubated with LPS (500 ng\\\/ml) in the presence or absence of PMB (500 \\u00b5g\\\/ml), representative flow cytometric analysis of CXCR7 expression alterations were showed. C, LPS exposure induced a significant CXCR7 expression increase in total RNA conten. D, Exposure of SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines to LPS (500 ng\\\/ml) had no effect on CXCR4 expression.\\n\\nCXCR7 normally was minimally expressed, whereas CXCR4 was expressed at high level in SW480 cells. Real-time quantitative-PCR and flow cytometry clearly indicated that the exposure of SW480 cells expressing TLR4\\\/MD-2 to LPS induced CXCR7 expression alterations significantly (p<0.001, p<0.001, resp.; ). CXCR7 and CXCR4 were not expressed on Colo 205 cells. Similar results of LPS induced CXCR7 expression alterations significantly appeared in Colo 205 cells (p<0.001, p<0.001, resp. ).The natural peptide PMB is a well-known and potent antibiotic that binds and neutralizes bacterial endotoxin (LPS). In our study, PMB, the LPS inhibitor, inhibited the LPS-induced CXCR7 expression alterations (). Maximal LPS effects were observed on CXCR7 protein expression after 24 h exposure to a dose of 500 ng\\\/ml, representative examples of flow cytometry are shown (). In contrast to LPS induced CXCR7 expression alterations, exposure of SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines to LPS had no effect on CXCR4 expression ().\\n\\nIn addition, CXCR7 and CXCR4 were not expressed on HT-29 cells. Exposure of HT-29 cells with expression of only TLR4 to LPS had no effect on CXCR7 or CXCR4 expression (data not shown).\\n\\nKnockdown of MD-2 inhibits LPS-mediated CXCR7 expressionIn order to investigate the role of MD-2 in LPS-mediated CXCR7 expression, we subjected SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines expressing TLR4\\\/MD-2 to transient transfection with the siRNA specific for the MD-2 gene. 2 cell lines transfected with the MD-2 siRNA sequence exhibited a marked reduction in the abundance of the endogenous MD-2 mRNA and protein level compared with that in cells transfected with the negative control sequence ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0027399.g002Figure 2Knockdown effect of MD-2 on exposure of TLR4 to LPS in SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines.A, SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines were transfected transiently with siRNA or negative control sequence(NC). SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines transfected with the MD-2 siRNA sequence exhibited a marked reduction in MD-2 mRNA and protein level compared with NC. B, After LPS treatment, flow cytometry and real-time quantitative-PCR were performed. Knockdown of MD-2 inhibited LPS-mediated CXCR7 expression.\\n\\nIncubation of SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines transfected with the MD-2 siRNA sequence with LPS did not reveal an increase in CXCR7 mRNA and protein expression. In contrast, transfection with the negative control sequence in cells resulted in a marked increase in CXCR7 expression in response to LPS (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.001, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.002, resp.; ). These results suggest that MD-2 is essential for LPS-induced CXCR7 expression alteration.\\n\\nCXCR7 mediated by LPS modulates tumor cell proliferation and migrationSubsequently, we used a novel CXCR7-specific antagonist CCX771 and an endogenous CXCR7 ligand (CXCL12) to investigate the role of CXCR7 in regulating CXCL12-mediated colorectal carcinoma cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration.\\n\\nIncubation with LPS, the growth and viability of SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines for 24 h and 48 h in the presence or absence (control) of CXCL12 were examined. Because CXCR4 expressed on SW480 cells is another receptor for CXCL12, SW480 cells were pretreated (1 h) with a CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 in some of the experiments. Upon CXCL12 stimulation, SW480 cells pretreated with AMD3100 proliferated significantly after 48 h (p<0.001, p<0.001, resp.; ). In addition, SW480 cells pretreated with CCX771 proliferated significantly after 48 h (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.001, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.015, resp.; ). However, the proliferative effect of CXCR7 is more than that of CXCR4 (p<0.001; ). At the same time, though CXCR4 was not expressed in Colo 205 cells incubated with LPS, CXCR7 significantly induced proliferation in Colo 205 cells ( p\\u200a=\\u200a0.003; ). The proliferative effect of CXCR7 was blocked by a CXCR7 antagonist CCX771 (p<0.001; ).\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0027399.g003Figure 3Proliferation, apoptosis and migration of CXCR7-positive SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines incubated with LPS.A, Incubation with LPS, SW480 cell line pretreated with AMD3100 (10 \\u00b5g\\\/ml) proliferated significantly in response to CXCL12 (100 ng\\\/ml; 48 h), Colo 205 cell line also proliferated significantly in response to CXCL12. B, CXCL12 activation of its receptor CXCR7 did not exert an antiapoptotic effect. C, Pretreatment with AMD3100, SW480 cell line migrated significantly more in response to CXCL12 after 24 h of incubation with LPS, Colo 205 cell line also migrated significantly in response to CXCL12.\\n\\nNo difference in apoptosis was detected in SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines grown with or without CXCL12 for up to 48 h, as demonstrated by the annexin V and propidium iodide binding assays (). Therefore, CXCR7 expressed on colorectal carcinoma cells results in cell proliferation, but may not exert an antiapoptotic effect.\\n\\nWe also performed transwell migration assays to determine whether CXCR7 induces migration of colorectal carcinoma cells. After 24 h of incubation with LPS, not only CXCR7 but also CXCR4 expressed in SW480 cells significantly induced migration in the presence of CXCL12 (p<0.001, p<0.001, resp.; ). However, there was no significant difference in migration effect of CXCR7 and CXCR4 (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.102; ). Incubated with LPS, CXCR7 significantly induced migration in Colo 205 cells unexpressed CXCR4 (p<0.001; ). The migration effect of CXCR7 was blocked by a CXCR7 antagonist CCX771 (p<0.001; ).\\n\\nTaken together, these findings suggest that CXCR7 may significantly uphold colorectal carcinoma cell proliferation and promote cell migration.\\n\\nTLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 are expressed in human colorectal carcinoma tissuesTo further substantiate the growth-promoting and pro-migration effects of CXCR7 mediated by TLR4, we investigated the clinicopathologic significance of TLR4, MD-2 and CXCR7 expression using immunohistochemistry in human colorectal carcinoma tissues. TLR4, MD-2 and CXCR7 exhibited mostly cytoplasmic and plasmalemmal staining in colorectal carcinoma tissues (). Normal tissue adjacent to tumor cells showed negative or occasionally weak staining that was mostly cytoplasmic (). The differences in expression of the three molecules (TLR4, MD-2 and CXCR7) between normal colorectal tissues and colorectal carcinoma tissues were all found to be statistically significant (p<0.001, p<0.001, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.034, resp.; ).\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0027399.g004Figure 4Representative examples of immunohistochemical staining of TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 in colorectal carcinoma tissues (original magnification 100\\u00d7).Positive staining was observed as a dark brown color.

Moreover, there are statistically significant differences in high expression of single TLR4, MD-2, or CXCR7 molecules, and high expression of both of TLR4\\\/CXCR7, or MD-2\\\/CXCR7 molecules with regard to distant metastasis in patients with colorectal carcinoma (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.009, p\\u200a=\\u200a0.001, resp.; ). However, this result did not apply in the case of combination of TLR4\\\/MD-2 (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.081; ). Combined high expression of all three molecules is significantly associated with distant metastasis in patients with colorectal carcinoma as compared with cases of high expression in fewer than all three (p\\u200a=\\u200a0.042; ).\\n\\nDiscussionIn this study, we show that LPS-TLR4-MD-2 induced CXCR7 expression alteration in the colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines. CXCR7 mediated by TLR4 modulated tumor cell proliferation and migration. However, exposure of SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines to LPS had no effect on CXCR4 expression. Furthermore, higher rates of TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 expression were found in colorectal carcinoma tissues than in normal tissues. There was a statistically significant correlation between single TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 expression levels and human colorectal carcinoma TNM stage, advanced histological grade, tumor size and lymph node metastasis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that concomitant expression of the three molecules TLR4, MD-2 and CXCR7 is associated with increased carcinoma growth and metastasis potential in human colorectal carcinoma.\\n\\nThe link between inflammation and cancer suggests that the mechanisms contributing to inflammation may also be critical for tumor formation and progression. TLRs comprise a group of pattern recognition receptors which can sense pathogen invasion. TLR4 is expressed in a variety of tumors, and TLR4 activation can promote development and progression, apoptosis resistance, invasion, metastasis of tumors and tumor immune escape \\u2013. Among all the TLR4 accessory molecules, MD-2 is the only one that is absolutely required for the response to LPS \\u2013. Pathogens have devised many strategies to evade or manipulate TLR4\\u2013MD-2 activity. Once LPS binds to TLR4 two signaling pathways are activated: a MyD88-dependent pathway and a MyD88-independent pathway. Based on studies using macrophages, these pathways are responsible for expression of NF-kB\\\/pro-inflammatory cytokines \\u2013, can alter some cell functions: cytoprotection, apoptosis, etc. In our present work, knockdown of MD-2 in SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines has indeed provided evidence that MD-2 is indispensable for TLR4 signaling. Simultaneously, LPS had no effect on CXCR7 or CXCR4 expression of HT-29 cells not expressing MD2, with expression of only TLR4. Moreover, the differences in expression of TLR4 and MD-2 between normal colorectal tissues and colorectal carcinoma tissues were all found to be statistically significant. Increased expression of TLR4 and MD-2 was significantly associated with TNM stage and advanced histological grade. Concomitant and high expression of both markers TLR4\\\/MD-2 was more predictive of tumor size and lymph node involvement.\\n\\nThe development of metastasis is complex, requiring multiple individual steps to successfully establish a tumor at a secondary site. The process requires a tumor cell to acquire the ability of proliferation, anti-apoptosis, migration and invasion, et al. Increasing evidence suggests that chemokines and their receptors are closely related to the mediation of inflammation, chemotaxis of white blood cells and tumor biology. CXCR4\\\/CXCL12, induced by pro-inflammatory cytokines plays a role in metastasis of tumors by inducing chemotactic, proliferative and invasive response . The second chemokine receptor of CXCL12, CXCR7 was formerly known as RDC1 . As a membrane associated receptor protein, CXCR7 is expressed on the surface of many tumor cells \\u2013, activated endothelial cells, and fetal liver cells, but rarely in other normal cells. There is growing discussion about CXCR7 enhancing tumor growth and migration through various signaling pathways \\u2013. However, some scientists consider that CXCR7 is a non-signaling receptor (decoy receptor) , which binds the ligands CXCL12 and ITAC\\\/CXCL11, does not activate typical G\\u03b1i pathways of a chemokine receptor that would result in GTP hydrolysis or calcium mobilization . Therefore, we became interested in the role of the CXCR7\\\/CXCL12 axis in the biologic processes of colorectal carcinoma. Moreover, we tried to verify the relationship between TLR4-MD-2 and CXCR7, which has not been previously investigated.\\n\\nOur data showed a marked increase of CXCR7 expression in a TLR4\\\/MD-2 positive colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines in response to LPS. Knockdown of MD-2 inhibited LPS-mediated time- and dose-dependent CXCR7 expression alterations. Furthermore, exposure of SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines to LPS had no effect on CXCR4 expression. CXCR7 and CXCR4 expressed on tumor cells significantly induced proliferation and migration in the presence of CXCL12. However, in this study, the proliferative effect of CXCR7 is more than that of CXCR4, there was no significant difference in migration effect of CXCR7 and CXCR4. Then, the differences in expression of CXCR7 between normal colorectal tissues and colorectal carcinoma tissues were found to be statistically significant. There was a statistically significant correlation between CXCR7 expression and TNM stage and advanced histological grade. We also found CXCR7 was an independent predictor of metastasis - independent of size and histological grade.\\n\\nNotably, the present study suggests that TLR4, MD-2, and CXCR7 are highly expressed in colorectal carcinoma. Furthermore, the concomitant and high expression of all three markers is significantly associated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and distant metastasis. However, more evidence will be needed to identify the mechanism of TLR4-MD-2 activation through CXCR7-mediated signaling and their synergistic role in tumors.\\n\\nIn summary, we have shown that the alteration of CXCR7 expression mediated by TLR4 promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration in human colorectal carcinoma. This suggests that infective states are not merely related to surrounding inflammatory products but also to an effect of LPS on occurrence and development of colorectal carcinoma. Crosstalk among the three proteins TLR4, MD-2, or CXCR7 may be closely related to promotion of tumor growth and metastasis. Inhibition of TLR4, MD-2, or CXCR7 may be an effective adjuvant therapy for colorectal carcinoma.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsCell lines and cultureThe following human colorectal carcinoma cell lines were from American type culture collection (ATCC): Caco-2, HT-29, DLD-1, Colo 205, HCT 116, RKO, SW480 and SW620.\\n\\nCaco-2 cells were cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (Catalog No. 30-2003, ATCC, USA) supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U\\\/ml), and streptomycin (100 \\u00b5g\\\/ml) at 37\\u00b0C and in 5% CO2.

All participants gave informed written consent before participating in the study. Colorectal carcinoma samples were collected from 66 patients undergoing curative-intent surgery at the Department of Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Bengbu Medical College, and the Department of Surgery, Renji Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine between 2005 and 2011. There were also 20 normal colorectal tissue samples adjacent to colorectal carcinoma (used as controls). The histologic sections were reviewed by two expert pathologists to verify the histologic diagnosis. None of the patients had received any preoperative treatment. Tumors were staged according to the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) pathologic tumornode-metastasis (TNM) classification. Informed consent was obtained from all study subjects before sample collection and these samples were used according to ethical standards.\\n\\nAntibodies and other reagentsLPS (Catalog No. L6011) and Polymyxin B (PMB; Catalog No. P4932), the LPS inhibitor, were from Sigma-Aldrich, USA. Monoclonal anti-human TLR4 antibody (Clone ab22048), monoclonal anti-human MD-2 antibody (Clone ab24182) were from Abcam, England; monoclonal anti-human CXCR7 antibody (Clone MAB4227) from R&D systems, USA; monoclonal anti-human CXCR4 antibody (Clone 5555974) from BD, USA; a CXCR4 antagonist (AMD3100) from Sigma-Aldrich, USA; CXCL12 (Clone 2716-SD-025\\\/CF) from R&D, USA. A CXCR7 antagonist (CCX771) was kindly provided by ChemoCentryx. HRP-conjugated secondary antiserum (Clone A0216, Beyotime, China) was used in Western blotting assay.\\n\\nReverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and real-time quantitative-PCR assayTotal RNA was isolated from colorectal carcinoma cell lines using TRIzol (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and reverse transcribed. The primers for TLR4 were 5\\u2032-TGCAATGGATCAAGGACCAGAGG-3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032-TGCAGCCAGCAAGAAGCATCAG-3\\u2032. The primers for MD-2 were 5\\u2032-CCGAGGATCTGATGACGATT A-3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032-GGCTCCCAGAAATAGCTTCAA -3\\u2032. The primers for CXCR7 were 5\\u2032- CACAGCACAGCCAGGAAGG-3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032-GTTCCCTGGCTCTGAGTAGTCGA-3\\u2032. PCR products were analysed by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. The real-time quantitative-PCR reaction was performed using SYBR Green master mix (ABI, Foster City, CA). GAPDH gene was used as an endogenous control for sample normalization. The primers for GAPDH were 5\\u2032-GGATTTGGTCGTATTGGG-3\\u2032 and 5\\u2032-GGAAGATGGTGATGGGATT-3\\u2032. Data were collected and quantitatively analyzed on an ABI Prism 7900 sequence detection system. Differences in the relative levels of three markers normalized to GAPDH can be estimated by differences in the ratios.\\n\\nFlow cytometric assayFor in vitro studies of CXCR7 and CXCR4 expression regulation, all cell lines were cultured in 2% FBS. After 12 h, colorectal carcinoma SW480, Colo 205 and HT-29 cells were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of PMB. Cultures were trypsinized and 5\\u00d7105 cells were incubated for 1 h with a monoclonal anti-human CXCR7 or CXCR4 antibody, and analysed using a Becton Dickinson FACSCan with CellQuest software. Cells from the SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines were isolated and gated to exclude dead and GFP-negative cells so that only cells that were GFP positive were analysed.\\n\\nTransient transfectionA sequence of 19-nucleotide residues in length (GUGGGAGAGAUUUAAAGCA) specific to the human MD-2 cDNA (nucleotide residues, 222\\u2013241) was selected for synthesis of a siRNA (GenenPharma, USA). The siRNA was dissolved in DEPC water and transfected into colorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrigen, USA). Effects of siRNA for MD-2 was compared with those of a random siRNA sequence (negative control sequence). The depletion of endogenous MD-2 by the siRNA was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot.\\n\\nWestern blot analysisColorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines were lysed in RIPA Lysis Buffer (Beyotime, China) supplemented with protease inhibitor Cocktail (Catalog No. A7706_0001, AppliChem, Germany). Protein concentration in the postnuclear lysates was measured by BCA Protein Assay (Beyotime, China) and equal amounts of protein lysates (60 \\u00b5g) were loaded on 10% SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose using iBlot Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen, USA). Filters were blocked with 5% dry skimmed milk and blotted with the specific primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibody to MD-2. Blots were then incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antiserum, and signal revealed with the WestPico chemiluminescence system (Pierce). Filters were stripped for 10 min with ReBlot Plus Strong Antibody Stripping Solution (Millipore).\\n\\nCell proliferation assayColorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines were cultured in 96-well plates at an initial density of 2,000 cells per well, in 100 \\u00b5l of 1% FBS-medium without (control) or with addition of CXCL12 (100 ng\\\/ml). In some of the experiments, SW480 cells were pretreated (1 h) with CCX771 (1 UM) and\\\/or AMD3100 (10 \\u00b5g\\\/ml), Colo 205 cells were pretreated (1 h) with CCX771 (1 UM). After 24 h, and 48 h, effects of CXCL12 on cell proliferation were determined by using a WST-1 Kit (Beyotime, China). Each experimental condition was sampled in duplicate and the experiments were repeated five times.\\n\\nApoptosis assayColorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines were incubated in 1% FBS-medium without (control) or with addition of CXCL12 (100 ng\\\/ml). In some of the experiments, SW480 cells were pretreated (1 h) with CCX771 (1 UM) or\\\/and AMD3100 (10 \\u00b5g\\\/ml), Colo 205 cells were pretreated (1 h) with CCX771 (1 UM). After 24 h and 48 h, the cells were washed with incubation buffer, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 0.5 mg\\\/ml propidium iodide (eBioscience, USA) and annexin V-FITC (eBioscience, USA). 2\\u00d7105 cells were collected for each sample by flow cytometry. Each experiment was repeated five times.\\n\\nMigration experimentsColorectal carcinoma SW480 and Colo 205 cell lines were resuspended in 1% FBS-medium of 5\\u00d7105 cells\\\/ml, and seeded into the upper chambers of Transwell inserts (Millipore). 1% FBS-medium was added to the lower chambers, without (control) or with addition of CXCL12 (100 ng\\\/ml). In some of the experiments, SW480 cells were pretreated (1 h) with CCX771 (1 UM) or\\\/and AMD3100 (10 \\u00b5g\\\/ml), Colo 205 cells were pretreated (1 h) with CCX771 (1 UM).. The migration was carried out at 37\\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 24 h. After incubation, the nonmigrated cells were removed from the upper surface of the filters, and the migrated cells, adherent to the lower surface, were counted (ten high-power fields\\\/well). Each experiment was repeated five times.\\n\\nImmunohistochemistry assaySections were subjected to routine deparaffination and rehydration. Antigen retrieval was achieved by microwaving in 0.01 mol\\\/L citrate buffer for 10 min and then cooling for 30 min. The endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited by incubation with 3% hydrogen peroxide in methanol for 20 min and nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation with 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature. After three PBS washes, the specimens were reacted overnight at 4\\u00b0C with murine anti-human monoclonal antibodies: anti-TLR4, anti-MD-2 and anti-CXCR7. After incubation with rat anti-mouse-IgG2b-horseradish peroxidase, signal was developed with 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride in Tris\\u2013HCl buffer (pH 7.6) containing 0.02% hydrogen peroxide. The sections were then counterstained with hematoxylin and mounted. Negative controls were performed by replacing the primary antibody with nonspecific IgG at the same concentration.\\n\\nInterpretation and evaluation of immunohistochemical resultsImmunostaining was independently examined by two clinical pathologists who were unaware of the patient outcome. For each sample, five high-power fields (100\\u00d7) were randomly selected. Staining intensity and percentage of positive tumor cells were assessed. The extent of the staining was categorized into five semiquantitative classes based on the percentages of positive tumor cells: 0 (<5% positive cells), 1 (6\\u201325% positive cells), 2 (26\\u201350% positive cells), 3 (51\\u201375% positive cells) and 4 (>75% positive cells). The intensity of cytoplasmic and membrane staining was also determined semiquantitatively on a scale of 0\\u20133 as follows: 0 (negative), 1 (weakly positive), 2 (moderately positive) and 3 (strongly positive). A consensus score was assigned for each section after discussion and careful review of all slides by the two pathologists. Multiplication of the intensity and the percentage scores gave rise to the final staining score: 0 (negative), + (1\\u20134), ++ (5\\u20138), and +++ (9\\u201312). For statistical analysis, tumors having a final staining score of negative or +, which showed a weak or moderate\\\/strong immunoreactivity were grouped into a low expression group and were compared to tumors with scores of ++ or +++ as the high expression group.\\n\\nStatistical analysisDifferences were evaluated using Statistical Package for Social Science software (version 16.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). The association of staining intensity with clinicopathologic patterns was assessed with the Chi square test and two-sided Fisher's exact test to determine the significance of the difference between the the covariates. A logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95%confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between CXCR7 and ymph node metastases. All measurement data are presented as mean \\u00b1 SEM. Statistical significance was evaluated by one-way ANOVA, followed by least significant difference (LSD) test. P values<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"Lipopolysaccharides\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"ACKR3\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"Lipopolysaccharides results in increased expression of ACKR3 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Lipopolysaccharides\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"TLR4\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"Lipopolysaccharides binds to TLR4 protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"affects^binding\"}]"}]}

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the Keap1-Nrf2 signalling and autophagy pathways after DEP exposure. BEAS-2B cells were transfected with silencing RNA (siRNA) specific to Nrf2 and exposed to DEP. The relative levels of mRNA for Nrf2, NQO1, HO-1, LC3B, p62 and Atg5 were determined using RT-PCR, while the levels of LCB3, Nrf2, and p62 protein were determined using Western blotting.

Air pollution particulate matter (PM) induces oxidative stress in airway tissues, causing living organisms to activate their defences to prevent cell death\\u2013. One mechanism that cells use for defence against oxidative stress is autophagy, which is a homeostatic process that reduces cytoplasmic volume by degrading damaged organelles and proteins through a lysosome-dependent degradation process, and new organelles and proteins are synthesized as replacements\\u2013. Previous studies have emphasized that exposure to PM induces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and increases the levels of autophagy and cell death\\u2013.\\n\\nSome of the most harmful components of urban PM are derived from diesel exhaust particles (DEP),. Usually, composed of carbon nuclei, DEP have large surface areas that can adsorb other chemicals in the environment, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), sulphate, nitrate, metals, carbon monoxide, aldehydes and various low molecular weight hydrocarbons,. PAHs and their derivatives are especially important because they are able to generate ROS in tissues.\\n\\nGenes encoding key antioxidant enzymes are important for maintaining intracellular redox homeostasis through the antioxidant response element (ARE) found within the promoter regions of these genes. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2 (NFE2L2, also known as Nrf2) induces ARE genes as part of a protective response against oxidative challenge to organelles and macromolecules.\\n\\nRecent in vivo and in vitro models have shown that the oxidative damage caused by PM exposure can activate the Nrf2-antioxidant response element signalling pathway,. Additionally, A549 cell and murine alveolar macrophage cultures exposed to DEP have shown increased Nrf2 and HO-1 (an Nrf2 target gene) expression levels.\\n\\nThere is evidence that some autophagy genes, such as Atg5, Atg4D and SQSTM1\\\/p62, have ARE promoter regions, and these promotors may be regulated through Nrf2 activity. Nrf2 is normally present in the cytoplasm attached to Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1), which facilitates the ubiquitination and proteolysis of Nrf2. In addition, protein p62 interacts with the same binding site as that of Nrf2-Keap1 and competitively inhibits the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction. The accumulation of p62 within the cells allows it to interact with Keap1 more frequently, resulting in the inhibition of Keap1 and, consequently, the activation of Nrf2,. Also, p62 has been found to be a mediator in the formation of protein aggregates for autophagy recycling, functioning as an adapter for facilitating the binding of ubiquitinated protein aggregates and delivering them to autophagosomes, by associating with LC3 (protein light chain 3) a protein in autophagosome membrane\\n\\nThe aim of this study was to examine the role of DEP in the Nrf2\\\/ARE-mediated oxidant response and the influence of this pathway on the induction of autophagy in the human BEAS-2B bronchial cell line.\\n\\nResultsDEP characterizationTo verify the composition of the DEP collected, two characterization assays were performed: EDX (X-ray fluorescence by the energy dispersive method) to determine elements that comprise the DEP (Table\\u00a0); high-performance liquid chromatography to separate the PAH fractions and their derivatives; and gas chromatography in conjunction with mass spectrometry (GC\\\/MS) was chosen for identification and quantification (Table\\u00a0). The results show high concentrations of PAH and metals in the DEP sample.Table 1Elementary compounds of DEP.\\n\\nElementEDXElementEDXCr16,14\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200911,20Ba24,78\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200915,68Mn22,62\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091,34Pb2,29\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091,60Fe(%)0,29\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,00Na(%)0,21\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,03Co79,85\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20095,47Mg3,99\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20096,06Ni3,27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091,73Al0,67\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,58Cu14,09\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091,15Si338,24\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200917,07Zn285,21\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,51P318,49\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093,89As2,94\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091,59S(%)0,27\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,00Br2,05\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091,30K73,29\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092,51Rb1,35\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,59Ca(%)0,18\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,00Zr1,43\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,38Sc150,03\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093,97Cd1,01\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20090,01Cl5,20\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20091,36The quantity of elements is calculated in ppm (part per million), except those indicated by \\u201c%\\u201d.

The MTT test is a measure of metabolic activity, while the Trypan blue test is a direct measure of the cell death rate. The results of the MTT assay showed that DEP exposure significantly reduced formazan absorbance, with significant differences between the 20\\u2009min and 2\\u2009h groups (p\\u2009=\\u20090.009) and between the 1 and 2\\u2009h groups (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01) (Fig.\\u00a0). The results of the Trypan blue assay indicate that exposure to 50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL DEP significantly increased the percentage of dead cells compared to the number in the control (p\\u2009=\\u20090.007) and 10\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL (p\\u2009=\\u20090.015) groups. Additionally, exposure to 100\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL DEP concentration for 2\\u2009h increased the percentage of dead cells among all groups: 100\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL vs. the control (p\\u2009=\\u20090.009); 100\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL vs. 10\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL (p\\u2009=\\u20090.010); 100\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL vs. 50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL (p\\u2009=\\u20090.025) (Fig.\\u00a0). Taken together, these results allowed the decision for the concentrations of 10\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL and 50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL, which did not show a greater than 30% reduction in cell viability.Figure 1Cytotoxicity Assays: (A) Results from the analysis of formazan absorbance produced by cells exposed only to LHC-9 culture medium (control), DEP at 10\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL, DEP at 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL, and DEP at 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL. A significant difference was found for exposure times (p\\u2009=\\u20090.015). Results from the Holm-Sidak test showed a difference between the times of 20\\u2009min and 2\\u2009h (p\\u2009=\\u20090.009) and between the times of 1\\u2009h and 2\\u2009h (p\\u2009=\\u20090.01) for the groups exposed to the DEP.

A significant difference was found for concentrations (p\\u2009=\\u20090.004). The Holm-Sidak method showed a difference between groups: 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL vs. the control (p\\u2009=\\u20090.009); 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL vs. 10\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL (p\\u2009=\\u20090.010); 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL vs. 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/ml (p\\u2009=\\u20090.025); 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL vs. the control (p\\u2009=\\u20090.007); and 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL vs. 10\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/ml (p\\u2009=\\u20090.015).\\n\\n\\n\\nDEP increase the mRNA expression of both autophagic and antioxidant genesThe cells were exposed to DEPs at 10 and 50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL concentrations (DEP10 and DEP50) for 2\\u2009h. Along with DEPs exposure, an RT-PCR assay was performed to verify the autophagy and antioxidation markers using autophagy and Nrf2 system controls. The following substances were used as controls: 1) EBSS to induce starvation in cells; 2) sulforaphane at a 10\\u2009\\u00b5M concentration for 2\\u2009h to activate the Nrf2 system; and 3) bafilomycin at a 10\\u2009nM concentration for 4\\u2009h to inhibit autophagic flux. We analysed the following genes: 1) LC3B, p62 and Atg5 in the autophagy pathway and 2) Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 in the antioxidant pathway.\\n\\nThe results showed that DEP50 treatment lead to increased gene expression for both Nrf2-system and autophagy markers (Fig.\\u00a0), mainly when compared with autophagy controls EBSS and bafilomycin. DEP10 treatment increased Nrf2, HO-1 and p62 levels, mainly when compared with control and bafilomycin treatments (Fig.\\u00a0), indicating that both treatments are able to interfere in both pathways. Interestingly, Nrf2-system induction by sulforaphane increased the expression of the autophagy markers p62 and LC3B (Fig.\\u00a0), mainly when compared to control, whereas autophagy impairment by bafilomycin negatively interfered with the expression of Nrf2-regulated proteins: Nrf2, NQO1 and HO-1 (Fig.\\u00a0), mainly when compared to DEP50 treatment. These results indicate that were able to interfere in both pathways (Fig.\\u00a0).Figure 2Results of gene expression analysis (RT-PCR) for the autophagy and Nrf2-system markers after exposure to 10 and 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL DEP for 2\\u2009h, EBSS for 40\\u2009min, 10\\u2009nM bafilomycin for 4\\u2009h and 10\\u2009\\u03bcM sulforaphane for 24\\u2009h. The quantities were calculated by the 2\\u2212\\u0394\\u0394CT method.

After 48\\u2009h of culture for transfection, the cells were exposed to DEP at concentrations of 10 and 50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 1\\u2009h and 2\\u2009h. The results showed that siRNA treatment significantly reduced the amount of p62 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001) (Fig.\\u00a0) and LC3B (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) (Fig.\\u00a0). The non-transfected BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP at a concentration of 10\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL for 2\\u2009h had increased Atg5 mRNA levels (p\\u2009=\\u20090.007) (Fig.\\u00a0), indicating that DEP induced Atg5 when Nrf2 was active in the cells. However, when Nrf2 was reduced through siRNA, there was a significant Atg5 decrease in the BEAS-2B cells transfected with siRNA compared with that in the BEAS-2B cells exposed to siDEP50 for 2\\u2009h (p\\u2009=\\u20090.024), thereby confirming that the Atg5 response is dependent on Nrf2.Figure 3Expression of autophagy and antioxidant markers in Nrf2-specific siRNA-transfected BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP at concentrations of 10\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL and 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL for 1\\u2009h and 2\\u2009h. The relative concentration of mRNA markers was determined by the 2\\u2212\\u0394\\u0394CT method. The results of the Kruskal-Wallis test showed a significant difference between the cells transfected with siRNA and non-transfected cells for the following genes: (A) Nrf2 (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001); (B) HO-1 (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), (C) LC3B (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), (D) p62 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001), and (E) Atg5 (p\\u2009=\\u20090.001). The pairwise multiple comparison test showed the differences between paired groups. The symbols \\u201c*\\u201d, \\u201c+\\u201d, \\u201c\\u25b2\\u201d, \\u201c\\u25a0\\u201d and \\u201c\\u25cb\\u201d represent the NTC, DEP10 1\\u2009h, DEP50 1\\u2009h, DEP10 2\\u2009h, and DEP50 2\\u2009h groups, respectively. Above the siRNA and siDEP group box plots, the list of symbols indicates significant results compared to the results of the NTC and DEP groups. The values of p for the pairs are described in Tables\\u00a0\\u2013 in the online resource.\\n\\n\\n\\nsiRNA treatment reduced the protein amountTo determine the proportion of each protein expressed under these conditions, Western blotting was performed with Nrf2, LC3B and p62 (Fig.\\u00a0). When compared to the levels of the BEAS-2B NTC cell groups, an evident decrease in these proteins was observed for all the siRNA-transfected BEAS-2B cell groups. For the BEAS-2B NTC cells, the results from the analysis of the Western blot bands showed an increase in Nrf2 after 2\\u2009h of exposure to DEP50 (R\\u2009=\\u20091.43) (Fig.\\u00a0) and an increase in p62 in the BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP10 (R\\u2009=\\u20091.3 for 1\\u2009h and R\\u2009=\\u20092.1 for 2\\u2009h) (Fig.\\u00a0). The amount of LC3II \\u2014 the functional form of LC3B \\u2014 was increased in the DEP10 1\\u2009h group (R\\u2009=\\u20091.46) and DEP50 1\\u2009h group (R\\u2009=\\u20091.3) (Fig.\\u00a0). LC3II was decreased in the siRNA-transfected BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP10 for 1\\u2009h, DEP10 for 2\\u2009h and DEP50 for 2\\u2009h to a greater extent than it was in the cells treated with siRNA alone (Fig.\\u00a0).Figure 4Proteins in the PVDF membranes as revealed by chemiluminescence. Samples were derived from the same experiment, and both gels were processed in parallel. The autophagy markers p62 and LC3I and II were analysed along with the expression of Nrf2. (A) Groups of cells transfected with the negative control and exposed to DEP at concentrations of 10 and 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL for 1\\u2009h and 2\\u2009h. All proteins in these groups were in the same membrane. (B) Groups of cells transfected with siRNA for Nrf2 and exposed to DEP at concentrations of 10 and 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL for 1\\u2009h and 2\\u2009h. All proteins shown are in the same membrane. The ratio of protein expression was determined by normalizing the expression of each protein of interest to that of \\u03b2-actin and the normalized value ratio to that of the control value (NTC). Thus, R (ratio) >1 is considered to indicate increased protein level and R\\u2009<\\u20091 indicates decreased protein level. All R values are shown in tabular form in the online resources (Table\\u00a0).\\n\\n\\n\\nAutophagosomes were reduced in the siRNA-transfected cellsAn immunofluorescence assay was performed with the BEAS-2B cells to verify autophagosome formation and Nrf2 protein expression (Fig.\\u00a0). The yellow appearance after the images were merged (Merge) indicates the overlap between the green and red markers; i.e., both proteins were present in the cell: LC3B (green) and Nrf2 (red). As shown in Fig.\\u00a0, autophagosomes are identified as bright green dots in both the LC3B and the Merge columns. The DEP10 2\\u2009h and DEP50 2\\u2009h groups had a higher number of green spots compared to that in the other groups, indicating that the autophagy was more intense in these groups. In the merged image of the DEP50 2\\u2009h group, the orange tone indicates the high intensity of the red spots (Nrf2). Figure\\u00a0 shows the BEAS-2B cells transfected with siRNA. The red staining is less intense because of Nrf2 suppression. LC3B is represented by positive green dots, and although less intense, they indicate that autophagy remained active when the cells were transfected with siRNA; however, autophagy remained much less active compared that in the non-transfected BEAS-2B cells.Figure 5Results of the immunofluorescence method: (A) cells transfected with the negative control and (B) cells transfected with siRNA groups. The blank arrows in the LC3B and Merge columns indicate more intense green spots corresponding to the autophagosomes. The blue arrows in the Nrf2 column indicate some positive markers, for which the red fluorescence is more intense. In the last column, Merge indicates the overlap of the green (LC3B), red (Nrf2) and DAPI images. The yellowish colour in the Merge image indicates the overlapping of the red and green colours, whereas the more intense green spots correspond to autophagosomes. Images were acquired with an Olympus BX51 microscope at 40\\u00d7 and 2\\u00d7 magnification using Image Pro Plus software. Merged images were generated using ImageJ software.\\n\\n\\n\\nDiscussionIn the present study, BEAS-2B cells were exposed to DEP at different times and concentrations to assess autophagy and antioxidant responses. The results indicate that DEP decrease cell viability and elicit the response of both biochemical pathways. The results of this study showed that the DEP concentrations of 10 and 50\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL for 2\\u2009h of exposure can activate both the antioxidant pathway \\u2014 increasing the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 \\u2014 and the autophagy pathway \\u2014 increasing p62 and LC3B expression. However, there were different responses between the two concentrations, which may be explained by particles behaviour in liquid solutions, since according to Seriani et al. at higher concentrations DEP tends to form large clusters while lower concentrations can penetrate epithelial cells more easily and fast, which may cause a different reaction in epithelium. In addition, siRNA treatment showed that autophagy is downregulated when the Nrf2 transcription factor showed low activity, indicating a positive relationship between the two mechanisms in maintaining cell survival in BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP.\\n\\nNrf2 is a transcription factor that regulates a series of proteins with promoter regions that have an ARE motif, including some genes related to autophagy, such as p62 and Atg5. The results of the present study indicate that Nrf2 activation positively regulates DEP-induced autophagy at the transcriptional level, as indicated by the considerable decrease in autophagy markers when Nrf2 was inhibited by siRNA, even during DEP exposure. Nrf2 suppression caused a significant decrease in the relative amounts of p62 and LC3B mRNA and decreased the relative protein levels of p62 and LC3II (Fig.\\u00a0). On the other hand, in the controls, sulforaphane-induced Nrf2 caused increased expression of Atg5, LC3B and p62. Taken together, the results showing the response of these autophagy markers \\u2014 decreasing when Nrf2 is inhibited or increasing when Nrf2 is expressed \\u2014 suggest that this transcription factor positively controls the transcription of these genes.\\n\\nThe immunofluorescence analysis results showed that the siRNA treatment reduced the frequency of green spots, as observed when the groups shown in Fig.\\u00a0 were compared to those shown in Fig.\\u00a0. The BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP for 2\\u2009h had yellow spots in Merge [a result of the overlapping LC3B (green) with Nrf2 (red)], greater intensity of the red dots representing Nrf2 and the green spots representing LC3B, attesting to the fact that DEP can induce both autophagy and the antioxidant pathway at the same time. The siRNA-transfected BEAS-2B cell groups showed a less intense yellow in the merged image than did the BEAS-2B cells not transfected with siRNA. The autophagy markers that were observed in the siRNA-transfected BEAS-2B cell groups can be considered long-lasting proteins that had already been produced in the cell prior to the siRNA transfection and may have been recycled by the autophagy mechanism itself, as indicated by the low levels of LC3B, Atg5 and p62 mRNA, which do not reflect de novo synthesis of these proteins.\\n\\nAutophagy induction has been linked to air pollution exposure. Lai et al. exposed A549 cells to DEP, urban dust and black carbon and found a significant increase in autophagy as indicated by the conversion of LC3I to LC3II. Long et al. demonstrated that exposure of bronchial cells to 2.5\\u2009\\u00b5m PM induced autophagy by overexpressing Atg5 and beclin-1, increasing the ratio of LC3I to LC3II proteins and increasing autophagosome formation. Bai et al. showed that PM1 (1 \\u03bcm) at a concentration of 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL induces autophagy and intracellular oxidative stress in type II alveolar epithelial cells in a dose-dependent manner. The authors also pre-treated the cells with antioxidants and chelators to show that the oxidative stress promoted by the particles was generated by the metals present in the PM composition (Fe, Cu and Mn). These pre-treatments also reduced the induction of autophagy in these cells compared to that in the cells treated with PM1 only. However, few studies have reported the participation of Nrf2 in the regulation of autophagy after PM or DEP exposure.\\n\\nThe relationship between the autophagy and antioxidant pathways mediated by Keap1-Nrf2 has been addressed in several studies using different substances. Wang et al. used cadmium-induced malignant transformation of BEAS-2B cells and found deficient autophagy levels, accumulation of p62 and constitutive activation of Nrf2 in these cells. However, sulforaphane treatment was able to restore autophagic flux and decrease Nrf2 expression in the transformed cells. In normal BEAS-2B cells, sulforaphane promoted Nrf2 activation, increased autophagy levels and decreased ROS levels, indicating that sulforaphane (and, as a consequence, Nrf2 activation) plays a dual role in regulating autophagy.\\n\\nSon et al. used nickel-transformed BEAS-2B cells and showed increased LC3II levels and overexpression of Stat3, a protein with a promoter region that has an ARE binding site. When Stat3 levels were suppressed, a reduction in LC3II level was found, while Nrf2 suppression resulted in depletion of Stat3, indicating that Nrf2 exerts an influence on the sensitivity of autophagy. Shah et al. demonstrated that arsenic induces p62 expression in vivo and in vitro. Keratinocytes were transfected with siRNA specific to Nrf2, resulting in the suppression of p62 expression, even when the keratinocytes were exposed to arsenic. The authors concluded that Nrf2 is the transcription factor critical for p62 expression. To elucidate the positive relationship between p62 and Nrf2, the authors treated the cells with siRNA for p62, having found decreased expression of HO-1, NQO1 and GCLC proteins, which each had a promoter region activated by Nrf2, indicating that Nrf2 depends on p62 to be activated and vice versa.\\n\\nHowever, in some studies, Nrf2 was associated with an inhibitor of autophagy. Lau et al. demonstrated that arsenic exposure in BEAS-2B cells activated Nrf2, disrupting autophagic flux and the accumulation of p62 and LC3B, resulting in a connection between Keap1 and p62. Additionally, when cells were treated with sulforaphane, a Nrf2 activation promoter, the autophagosome levels decreased. Zhu et al. demonstrated that exposure of BEAS-2B cells to cigarette smoke extract (CSE) increased the expression of LC3I and LC3II, p62 and NQO1. However, increased Nrf2 expression via inhibition of Keap1 resulted in decreased expression of LC3B, whereas siRNA specific to Nrf2 restored the levels of LC3I and II in the cells exposed to CSE, suggesting that Nrf2 activation can negatively regulate autophagy.\\n\\nThe divergence found in these studies indicates that the influence of Nrf2 on the autophagy pathway has not been fully comprehended. Antioxidant defence and autophagy are both involved in maintaining homeostasis and cell survival but may interact differently depending on the level of stress, suggesting that Nrf2 may be an important sensor of cell survival\\\/cell death. The results of the MTT and Trypan blue assays showed that the DEP caused a significant decrease in cell viability, indicating their toxicity. Several studies have pointed out that the cytotoxicity induced by exposure to DEP can lead to cell death events such as apoptosis and necrosis. Li et al. compared BEAS-2B cells and macrophages after exposure to DEP and demonstrated that BEAS-2B cells were more susceptible to the effect of the pollutant, causing a significant increase in necrotic cells. Seriani et al. demonstrated that, at the transcriptional level, BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP at 15\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL had significantly increased expression of the apoptotic protein caspase-3 and decreased expression of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2). Autophagy can be related as a cell death process, but is a different mechanism from apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, characterized by several characteristic morphological changes in cell structure and with various enzyme-dependent biochemical processes. However, in this study, cells had no apoptosis markers (data not shown) and had more than 70% of survival rate after DEP50 treatment and more than 90% after DEP10 treatment (Fig.\\u00a0), indicating that cells were on the threshold of a response to damage but were not on the threshold of death.\\n\\nTherefore, the positive or negative regulation of autophagy and\\\/or the antioxidant pathway can be attributed to the nature of the stimulus \\u2014 and in the case of this study, to DEP, in particular. To determine whether the composition of the collected material was similar to that expected, the PAHs and elements were characterized (Tables\\u00a0 and ). Although the characterization of DEP is the subject of studies seeking to understand how exposure causes adverse health effects, no patterns of quality or quantity have been determined for the regulation of these specific elements in the air, making it difficult to determine the threshold of the amount of the element in cellular damage. Nevertheless, this is the first study to show a dependent relationship between autophagy and Nrf2 pathways after DEP exposure, indicating that the Nrf2 oxidative stress response positively regulates autophagy at the transcriptional level.Table 3Study Groups for BEAS-2B transfected.\\n\\nGroupsDescriptionsiRNABEAS-2B transfected with siRNA to Nrf2siDEP10 1\\u2009hBEAS-2B transfected and exposed to DEP10\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 1\\u2009hsiDEP50 1\\u2009hBEAS-2B transfected and exposed to DEP50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 1\\u2009hsiDEP10 2\\u2009hBEAS-2B transfected and exposed to DEP10\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 2\\u2009hssiDEP50 2hBEAS-2B transfected and exposed to DEP50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 2\\u2009hsNTC \\u2013 Negative ControlBEAS-2B transfected with negative controlDEP10 1\\u2009hNTC BEAS-2B exposed to DEP 10\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 1\\u2009hDEP50 1\\u2009hNTC BEAS-2B exposed to DEP 50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 1\\u2009hDEP10 2\\u2009hNTC BEAS-2B exposed to DEP 10\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 2\\u2009hsDEP50 2hNTC BEAS-2B exposed to DEP 50\\u2009\\u00b5g\\\/mL for 2\\u2009hsTable 4Primers sequences.\\n\\nGenePrimer ForwardPrimer ReverseNrf2GCTATGGAGACACACTACTTGGCCAGGACTTACAGGCAATTCTKeap1CGTCCTGCACAACTGTATCTGTGTCTGTATCTGGGTCGTAACNQO1GGAAGAAACGCCTGGAGAATACAGGGAAGCCTGGAAAGATACHO-1GGTCCTTACACTCAGCTTTCTCATAGGCTCCTTCCTCCTTTCp62GGAACAGATGGAGTCGGATAACCTGGAAGAAGGCAGAGAAACTLCB3AGAGCAGCATCCAACCAAAATTGAGCTGTAAGCGCCTTCTAAATG5GCAACTCTGGATGGGATTGCAGGTCTTTCAGTCGTTGTCTGATRPL13AAAGGTGGTGGTCGTACGCTGTGCGGGAAGGGTTGGTGTTCATCC\\n\\nIn conclusion, this study showed that both the antioxidant defence promoted by Nrf2 and the autophagy mechanism acted together in the BEAS-2B cells exposed to diesel exhaust particulate matter through an increase in the expression of Nrf2, HO-1 and NQO1 and in the autophagy pathway proteins p62 and LC3B. However, the data available from the literature about how these mechanisms are related are conflicting. Our results indicated that the type of substance utilized (DEP) and the level of stress induced in the cell line used were determinants of the positive relationship between these pathways (Fig.\\u00a0). To test this hypothesis, further experiments are needed to determine whether any fraction or any specific component of the DEP is critical for the positive relationship between Nrf2 and autophagy presented here.Figure 6Summary of study completion. (A) DEP causes oxidative stress in cells, activating the Nrf2-system, which promotes antioxidant enzymes expression and positively regulates autophagy response. (B) under a decrease in Nrf2 expression, there is a drastic decrease in expression of antioxidant enzymes and autophagy markers.\\n\\n\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsThis research was approved by the Ethical Committee of the School of Medicine of S\\u00e3o Paulo University (number 119\\\/15).\\n\\nCell cultureA culture of BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cells, from an immortalized line (purchased from Sigma\\u2013Aldrich, Steinheim Germany, derived from normal bronchial epithelium obtained from autopsy of a non-cancerous individual) was prepared in flasks or plates coated with Matrigel (a substance that mimics the extracellular matrix) in the presence of LHC-9 growth medium supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum, 0.1% 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% antibiotic, 0.1% 1\\u2009mM pyruvate, and 0.1% non-essential 1\\u2009mM amino acids. The bottles and plates were kept in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37\\u2009\\u00b0C.\\n\\nChemicals and treatmentCells were exposed to bafilomycin (Sigma Aldrich) at 10\\u2009nM for 4\\u2009h as a negative control of autophagic pathways. Exposure to EBSS (Earle\\u2019s balanced salt solution, Gibco) for 40\\u2009min was used to promote cell starvation. Sulforaphane (Sigma Aldrich) was used at 10\\u2009\\u00b5M for 24\\u2009h as a positive control of the Nrf2 system. All supplements were removed from the LHC-9 medium 2\\u2009h before each experiment.\\n\\nDiesel exhaust particulate and treatmentThe DEP used in this study were collected from a diesel engine using a particulate retainer, a bimetallic filter that creates a field capable of holding the particulate matter emitted from exhaust. The vehicle chosen was a 2004 model Volkswagen bus with a 6-cylinder MWM x-10 engine. The bus is the property of a private company and circulates in the neighbourhood of Campo Belo, in Sao Paulo City, Brazil. The bus runs approximately 100 to 150\\u2009km\\\/day, and the particle retainer was linked to the exhaust for 1 week. DEP were collected in September\\\/October of 2015. Next, the DEP were removed from the particle retainer and weighed. For BEAS-2B cell exposure, the DEP were diluted 1:1 (1\\u2009mg\\\/mL) in phosphate-saline solution (PBS) with 0.1% ethanol. The DEP were diluted in culture medium at concentrations of 10, 50, and 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL.\\n\\nDiesel exhaust characterizationAs recommended by Laks et al., the elements that compose the material were determined using X-ray fluorescence and the energy dispersive method (EDX). As previously described, the HPA fractions and their derivatives were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and for the identification and quantification of these HPA fractions, gas chromatography was used in performed in conjunction ion with mass spectrometry (GC\\\/MS).\\n\\nCytotoxicity assaysMTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] assayIn a 96-well plate, 3\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009104 cells were seeded in each well, and DEP suspensions were added at 10, 50, and 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL concentrations. The cells were exposed at time intervals of 20\\u2009min, 40\\u2009min, 1\\u2009h and 2\\u2009h. After the cells were exposure to DEP, the wells were washed with PBS. A solution with 2.5\\u2009mg\\\/mL MTT (20%) was added into each well, and the cells were incubated for 4\\u2009h in a CO2 incubator. After 4\\u2009h, the cells in the plate were homogenized with DMSO for 30\\u2009min. The plates were read using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) reader at 570 and 630\\u2009nm. The data for each concentration and time were collected in triplicate and relative O.D were calculated to the control.\\n\\nTrypan blue assayIn a 12-well plate, 3\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009104 cells were seeded in each well with LHC-9 medium. The cells were exposed to DEP at 50 and 100\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL concentrations for 1 and 2\\u2009h. At the end of the experiment, the cells were washed with 1\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009PBS and subjected to trypsin. Next, the cells were collected in a sterile tube and centrifuged for 3\\u2009min at 5000\\u2009rpm. The supernatant was discarded, and the cells were resuspended in a Trypan Blue dye solution. Ten microliters of this dyed cell mixture was placed on a Countess slide (Invitrogen). The data for each concentration and time were collected in triplicate.\\n\\nBEAS-2B cell transfectionTo further investigate the effect of Nrf2 on the autophagic pathway in BEAS-2B cells exposed to DEP, silencing by interference RNA (siRNA) was used to degrade the Nrf2 mRNA to prevent its overexpression and to verify the mechanism through which the autophagy pathway is regulated under these conditions. Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Invitrogen), siRNA sequences s9394 (Ambion Silencer Select siRNA) and s9491 (Ambion Silencer Select siRNA) and a negative control (Ambion Silencer Select Negative Control) were each utilized at a concentration of 20 nM,. The negative control (NTC) simulates the same transfection conditions; however, the transfected RNA had a non-significant sequence. To facilitate transfection, siRNA and Lipofectamine were incubated with Opti-MEM medium for 5\\u2009min and added to the cell culture medium as instructed by the manufacturer and incubated for 48\\u2009h to complete the transfections. The groups of BEAS-2B cells are described in Table\\u00a0.\\n\\nRT-PCRBEAS-2B and siRNA-transfected BEAS-2B cells were seeded separately in 96-well plates at 3\\u2009\\u00d7\\u2009104 cells per well in triplicate for each cell group. After exposure to the treatments (DEP, sulforaphane, EBSS and bafilomycin), total RNA was extracted from the cell pellet using 700\\u2009\\u03bcL of Qiazol reagent (Qiagen) with an extraction column (RNeasy Mini kit Qiagen), according to the manufacturer\\u2019s instructions. The RNA was stored at \\u221280\\u2009\\u00b0C.

All samples were processed for RT-PCR in quadruplicate in a Rotor Gene 3000 instrument (Qiagen). The analysis was performed by calculating the relative quantity of each gene of interest in relation to a housekeeping gene, as indicated in the model described by Livak and Schmittgen and using the 2\\u2212\\u0394\\u0394CT formula. The primer sequences are listed in Table\\u00a0.

Following cell exposure, the proteins were collected with RIPA extraction buffer in the presence of protease inhibitors and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma Aldrich). Total protein was quantified by the Bradford method, and 50\\u2009\\u03bcg of protein was used for electrophoresis on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. After the proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane, the membrane was blocked in non-fat dry milk diluted to 5% in PBS with 0.1% Tween for 1\\u2009h. After blocking, the membrane was incubated overnight with antibodies against \\u03b2-actin (Sigma 1:10000), Nrf2 (Abcam 1:1000), LC3B (Abcam 1:1000) and p62 (Abcam 1:1000). Next, the membrane was washed 3 times with PBS-Tween and incubated with goat anti-rabbit HRP secondary antibody (1:1000) for 1\\u2009h. The membrane was then revealed by chemiluminescence using an ECL kit (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) on an ImageQuant\\u2122 LAS 4000 apparatus. Every image was captured after 10\\u201330\\u2009seconds of exposure. The proportion of each protein was obtained by the densitometry method.

In MKD, febrile temperature can further decrease the residual MK activity, leading to mevalonate pathway modulation and to possible disease worsening. We previously demonstrated that the administration of exogenous isoprenoids such as geraniol or the modulation of the enzymatic pathway with drugs, such as Tipifarnib, partially rescues the inflammatory phenotype associated with the defective mevalonic pathway. However, it has not been investigated yet how temperature can affect the success of these treatments. Thus, we investigated the effect of temperature on primary human monocytes from MKD patients. Furthermore the ability of geraniol and Tipifarnib to reduce the abnormal inflammatory response, already described at physiological temperature in MKD, was studied in a febrile condition. We evidenced the role of temperature in the modulation of the inflammatory events and suggested strongly considering this variable in future researches aimed at finding a treatment for MKD.\",\"full-text\":\"1. IntroductionMevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD), a rare autoinflammatory disease (OMIM no. 251170), is caused by mutations in the second enzyme of the mevalonate pathway (mevalonate kinase (MK)) resulting in reduced enzymatic activity and in the consequent shortage of downstream compounds [].\\n\\nMKD has an early onset usually in infancy and affects both sexes equally. A delay in molecular diagnosis frequently occurs, and systemic reactive AA amyloidosis, a form of amyloidosis, may be a severe long-term complication of this condition [\\u2013]. Different degrees of MKD severity were observed depending on MK residual activity, ranging from an autoinflammatory phenotype characterized by recurrent inflammatory episodes (Hyper-IgD Syndrome (HIDS), OMIM no. 260920) to a more severe clinical presentation, including neurological and psychomotor impairment (mevalonic aciduria (MA), OMIM no. 610377).\\n\\nThe lack of the mevalonate intermediate compound geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, resulting in the increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1\\u03b2 release, has been recently reported as the main pathogenic mechanism in MKD [, ].\\n\\nMultiprotein complexes called inflammasomes are capable of activating caspase-1, in response to many types of stimuli, including microbial and danger\\\/stress []. In particular, NALP3 inflammasome seems to be involved in the pathogenesis of MKD: inflammasome activation causes the increased secretion of IL-1\\u03b2 [] and the pyroptosis or caspase-1 dependent cell death [].\\n\\nThe main phenotypic characteristic of MKD patients is periodic fever. Temperature, indeed, plays a role in MKD, as elevated temperature (40\\u00b0C) can reduce even more the enzymatic activity of mutated MK, increasing the inflammatory response. However, an increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity will occur afterwards and compensate for the defect, allowing the resolution of the fever attack. These observations permitted to hypothesize that an increase in temperature may be involved in triggering the attacks [].\\n\\nAlthough in the last decade the knowledge of MKD pathogenesis has increased, an etiologic treatment for MKD is still unavailable, and anti-inflammatory drugs [] as well as novel biologic treatments [, ] are currently used with different and debatable results.\\n\\nWe recently showed that plant isoprenoids (such as geraniol) [] and inhibitors of farnesylation (such as Tipifarnib) [] could reverse the inflammatory response in cellular and animal MKD models [].\\n\\nExogenous isoprenoids are able to enter the mevalonate pathway, to be metabolized by the farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme of the mevalonate pathway downstream MK, and to rescue the shortage of intermediate isoprenoids in MKD, models []. On the other hand, farnesylation inhibitors can reduce the consumption of farnesyl pyrophosphate, augmenting the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate available for the geranylgeranylation pathway [, ] ().\\n\\nWe previously suggested that plant isoprenoids [] and inhibitors of farnesylation [] could represent a potential specific pharmacologic approach for MKD; however we did not yet consider how the temperature could act on the anti-inflammatory effect of these compounds in MKD.\\n\\nTo investigate the hypothesis that temperature could affect anti-inflammatory effects, geraniol and Tipifarnib were evaluated in primary human monocytes obtained from MKD patients at different temperatures (37\\u00b0C and 40\\u00b0C).\\n\\n2. Materials and Methods2.1. ReagentsLipopolysaccharide (LPS) (E. coli serotype 055:B5) and geraniol (GOH) (Sigma-Aldrich, Milano, Italy) were dissolved in saline solution. Tipifarnib ((Typ) R115777, Zarnestra) was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) so that the final concentration of DMSO would not exceed 0.1%. Tipifarnib was kindly provided by Professor G. Martinelli (Institute of Hematology \\u201cL and A Ser\\u00e0gnoli,\\u201d University of Bologna, Bologna, Italy).\\n\\n2.2. SubjectsThe study was approved by the technical and scientific review board of the Institute for Maternal and Child Health, IRCCS \\u201cBurlo Garofolo,\\u201d Trieste (no. 185\\\/08, 19\\\/08\\\/2008). For a child to be eligible, informed consent had to be obtained from parents or caregivers. Furthermore, MKD patients of any age were excluded from the study if they had an acute or chronic infectious disease, any clinically significant disorder, and if they were on any medication with known influence on immunological factors (e.g., corticosteroids).\\n\\nBlood was collected by venipuncture from 3 MKD patients aged between 9 and 12 years (). MKD patients had no concurrent infection and were not in the acute phase of the disease. Patients' histories of previous infectious diseases and allergy were documented but not evaluated as covariates in the study, because it may affect the results.\\n\\n2.3. Monocyte Isolation of Human Peripheral Blood MonocytesMonocytes were isolated from MKD patients. Cells were cultured at 2 \\u00d7 105 cells\\\/well in RPMI 1640 containing 10% FBS (Euroclone, Milan, Italy) with 1\\u2009\\u03bcg\\\/mL LPS for 24\\u2009h in presence or not of 100\\u2009\\u03bcM GOH or 5\\u2009\\u03bcM Typ. The same experimental design was performed at 37\\u00b0C (physiological condition) and at 40\\u00b0C (acute inflammation condition). At the end of the incubation period the cell culture supernatants were collected for cytokine and inflammasome evaluation while the cells were pelleted for the programmed cell death (PCD) assays.\\n\\n2.4. Programmed Cell Death (PCD) AssaysThe PCD of human monocyte was analyzed by flow cytometry using Annexin V (A) and Propidium Iodide (PI) stainings. Cells were stained with FITC-conjugated Annexin V and Propidium Iodide (Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit, Immunostep, Spain) following the manufacturer's indications. In brief, cells were harvested from the culture flasks and washed with PBS. 5 \\u00d7 105 cells were resuspended in manufacturer buffer and stained with A and PI for 15 minutes. Fluorescence was acquired with a FACScan Cytometer (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) and a CellQuest software (Becton Dickinson, NJ, USA) and subsequently analyzed with a FlowJo software (version 7.6, Treestar, Inc., OR, USA). Debris as excluded from the plot based on the scatter; then apoptotic and necrotic cells were characterized based on the fluorescence emitted.\\n\\n2.5. Determination of NALP3 (NLRP3) ConcentrationHuman NLRP3 concentration was determined in the cell culture medium by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits according to manufacturer's protocols, and the amount of NLRP3 was expressed as ng\\\/mL (Human NACHT, LRR and PYD domains-containing protein 3 ELISA Kit; Cusabio Biotech Co., ltd. Carlsbad, CA, USA).\\n\\n2.6. Determination of Cytokines ReleaseThe analysis of a 48 cytokines and chemokines panel (including IL-1\\u03b2, IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12(p70), IL-13, IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, FGF basic, G-CSF, GM-CSF, IFN-\\u03b3, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1\\u03b1, PDGF-BB, MIP-1\\u03b2, RANTES, TNF-\\u03b2, VEGF, IL-1\\u03b1, IL-2R\\u03b1, IL-3, IL-12(p40), IL-16, IL-18, CTACK, GRO-\\u03b1, HGF, IFN-\\u03b12, LIF, MCP-3, M-CSF, MIF, MIG, \\u03b2-NGF, SCF, SCGF-\\u03b2, SDF-1\\u03b1, TNF-\\u03b1, and TRAIL) was performed on supernatant samples using a magnetic bead-based multiplex immunoassays (Bio-Plex) (BIO-RAD Laboratories, Milano, Italy) following manufacturer's instructions. Data from the reactions were acquired using the Bio-Plex 200 reader, while a digital processor managed data output and the Bio-Plex Manager software returned data as median fluorescence intensity (MFI) and concentration (pg\\\/mL).\\n\\n2.7. Data AnalysisFor each set of experiments, values were analyzed by calculating means \\u00b1 standard error (SEM). The nonparametric one-way ANOVA test followed by Bonferroni's correction for multiple comparison test as used when appropriate. Probability (P) values were calculated on the basis of one-tailed test. Analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism software version 5.0 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA). A P value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant, unless established by the correction for multiple comparisons.\\n\\n3. ResultsMonocytes have been isolated from blood samples of three different MKD patients () and tested both at physiological (37\\u00b0C) and pathological (40\\u00b0C) temperatures in untreated conditions or after administration of proinflammatory stimulus alone or combined with anti-inflammatory compounds.\\n\\n3.1. Cytokines' Levels in Untreated Conditions or after LPS Administration at 37\\u00b0C and 40\\u00b0CIL-5, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, G-CSF, GM-CSF, MCP-1, MIP-1\\u03b2, RANTES, TNF-\\u03b1, IL-1\\u03b1, IL-2R\\u03b1, IL-3, IL-12(p40), IL-16, IL-18, CTACK, GRO-\\u03b1, HGF, IFN-\\u03b12, LIF, MCP-3, M-CSF, MIF, MIG, \\u03b2-NGF, SCF, SDF-1\\u03b1, TNF-\\u03b2, and TRAIL did not show any significant difference in untreated conditions nor after the administration of the proinflammatory compound LPS, at neither physiological nor pathological temperatures ().\\n\\nOn the other hand, levels of IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-12(p70), IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, FGF-basic, IFN-\\u03b3, IP-10, MIP-1\\u03b1, PDGF-BB, and VEGF were significantly dysregulated after the proinflammatory stimulus at 37\\u00b0C as well as at 40\\u00b0C. Still, same treatments at different temperatures did not differ significantly (, ).\\n\\n3.2. Cytokines' Levels after Administration of Anti-Inflammatory Compounds, GOH and Typ, on LPS-Stimulated Monocytes, at 37\\u00b0C and 40\\u00b0CLevels of cytokines, found to be dysregulated after LPS treatment, have then been evaluated, at both temperatures, after the combined administration of LPS + GOH or LPS + Typ. Drug treatments were not able to significantly nullify the effects of LPS. Nevertheless, a homogeneous trend was observed: GOH better rescued cytokines' levels with respect to Typ in all the tested samples (, ).\\n\\n3.3. Temperature-Induced Changes in IL-1\\u03b2 LevelsLPS was also able to dysregulate IL-1\\u03b2 levels both at 37\\u00b0C and at 40\\u00b0C, and it also did so for IL-1ra, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-12(p70), IL-15, IL-17, Eotaxin, FGF-basic, IFN-\\u03b3, IP-10, MIP-1\\u03b1, PDGF-BB, and VEGF. Even in this case, the combined treatments of LPS + GOH or LPS + Typ did not significantly modify the IL-1\\u03b2 levels with respect to the LPS treatment.\\n\\nInterestingly, IL-1\\u03b2 levels at 40\\u00b0C were notably lower in all experimental conditions with respect to those evaluated at 37\\u00b0C ().\\n\\n3.4. NAPL3 Inflammasome Levels Followed a Temperature Dependent Trend after Inflammatory StimulusIn any treatment condition, levels of NALP3 showed a decreasing trend as the temperature grew. In particular, this trend, showing higher levels at 37\\u00b0C with respect to 40\\u00b0C, was statistically significant in the LPS and LPS + GOH groups, while it was less marked in the LPS + Typ group. No differences were observed in the untreated groups ().\\n\\n3.5. Apoptosis Was Not Temperature Dependent in MKD MonocytesThe percentage of programmed cell death (PCD) significantly increased at 37\\u00b0C in LPS-treated cells if compared to untreated cells, while drugs treatments slightly reversed this effect. At 40\\u00b0C we noticed a small increase in PCD in the untreated cells with respect to the same group at 37\\u00b0C, whereas the other groups showed comparable trends and values with respect to those evaluated at 37\\u00b0C ().\\n\\n4. DiscussionMevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD) is characterized by a proinflammatory predisposition caused by the lack of mevalonate-derived isoprenoids. In MKD, severe inflammatory attacks can arise in response to mild immune stimuli such as stress or vaccinations. Indeed, due to the characteristic irregular recurrence of the attacks in patients, it may be difficult to evaluate the effect of therapeutic interventions. Moreover, studying the effectiveness of a treatment for a rare periodic syndrome is complicated by its frequency variability, disparate severity of symptoms, and its low prevalence: for this reason, a vaccination model has been proposed to evaluate the treatment on demand in a controlled setting [].\\n\\nWe previously reproduced a model of the disease in vitro and in vivo, in which shortage of isoprenoids and inflammatory predisposition were obtained by a biochemical block of the pathway, while the inflammatory attack was induced by acute treatment with proinflammatory compounds, such as muramyl dipeptide or LPS, mimicking vaccination [, ]. In these models, exogenous isoprenoids such as geraniol or drugs such as Tipifarnib, which are able to partially compensate the metabolic defect, have been shown to slightly correct the abnormal inflammatory predisposition []. Before translating these results on clinical trials, we further checked if these therapies maintained their efficacy in \\u201cfebrile\\u201d conditions. In fact, the mevalonate pathway can be modulated by temperature, and it has been suggested that high temperature can worsen the defect in isoprenoid synthesis.\\n\\nWe demonstrated that the LPS treatment versus the untreated condition induces a comparable inflammation response by testing patients' monocytes at 37\\u00b0C and 40\\u00b0C: cytokines' profile showed that the temperature does not affect cytokines' levels, acting only on the presence or absence of an inflammatory response.\\n\\nFurthermore geraniol and Tipifarnib maintain the same efficacy at different temperatures compared to LPS treatment: albeit not statistically significant, the effect of Tipifarnib seemed to be poorly relevant compared to geraniol. This difference in efficacy could be explained considering that GOH and Typ act at different levels of the pathway, respectively, rescuing the lack of intermediate compounds or redirecting the few produced toward an anti-inflammatory way (). Unfortunately, although previously studies already demonstrated a synergic effect of these two compounds [], the small number of monocytes isolated from patients did not allow verifying the potential joint effect of GOH and Typ.\\n\\nCytokines following this trend are equally secreted by Th1 (IL-2, INF-\\u03b3, IL-12, and IL-15), Th2 (IL-4, IL-6), and Th9 (IL-9) cells, thus meaning that the inflammatory phenotype is sustained by both innate and acquired immunity []. The inflammatory event arisen after LPS treatment is also driven by different chemokines which act as chemoattractant guiding the migration of immune cells. These molecules can recruit leukocytes, monocytes (VEGF, PDGF-BB, and FGF-basic) neutrophils (IP-10), and other effector cells from the blood [].\\n\\nHowever, in order to induce the inflammatory response, it is important to remark that the action of LPS alone is a necessary but not sufficient condition, since it acts as a trigger for inflammation in a pathological environment [].\\n\\nDifferent considerations should be made on IL-1\\u03b2, the most important inflammatory marker observed in MKD patients, since it seemed to be the only cytokine affected by the temperature. Both at 37\\u00b0C and at 40\\u00b0C the LPS treatment induced a statistically significant increase in IL-1\\u03b2 values if compared to untreated conditions, but the cytokine's level was dramatically lower at 40\\u00b0C. This diminishing trend as the temperature grows was observed also after the combined treatment LPS + GOH and, with a significant decrease, after the administration of LPS + Typ.\\n\\nNALP3 is another molecule that seems to vary as the temperature changes: all the different experimental conditions evaluated were decreased at 40\\u00b0C with respect to the values at 37\\u00b0C. These results perfectly relate to the data on IL-1\\u03b2, since NALP3 is the principal molecule involved in the inflammasome processes, and inflammasome activation causes an augmented secretion of IL-1\\u03b2 [, ].\\n\\nA fundamental aspect strictly linked with IL-1\\u03b2 and NALP3 is the process of apoptosis. This is the final mechanism triggered by NALP3\\\/IL-1\\u03b2 driven inflammation. However the percentage of PCD did not significantly change after the same treatments at different temperatures, even if the trend observed was perfectly comparable with that observed for the cytokines (except for IL-1\\u03b2). These results can be exhaustively explained taking into account that the IL-1\\u03b2 dependent apoptosis (pyroptosis) is not the only cause of cell death, which instead is principally driven by caspase-3 dependent apoptosis [\\u2013].\\n\\nWe are aware that due to the small number of patients analyzed we cannot definitively demonstrate the role of temperature and treatments for resetting the inflammatory processes to the homeostatic condition. However we can speculate that the differences in the cytokines' profile and response to the anti-inflammatory drugs (GOH and Tipifarnib) also depend on the physiological interindividual variability of the immune response and the genetic defect of the patient.\\n\\nIndeed, in MKD residual MK activity varies from <0.5% to 7% depending upon the type of MK mutation []. Taking in account that MK activity affects the levels of GGPP and the consequent shortage of geranylgeranylation, monocytes from subjects carrying different MK mutations could need different amounts of exogenous compounds to exhibit the same anti-inflammatory effect. A quantitative residual MK activity evaluation was not performed in our patients since it is not required for clinical definition of the disease.\\n\\nUnexpectedly, the temperature peak does not correspond to the highest values of proinflammatory markers, so we can speculate that the rescue of the pathway might be caused by the temperature increase itself. This conclusion is supported at a molecular level both by the concentration of released cytokines and by the NALP3-driven inflammasome activation. Thus, temperature represents at the same time not only the acute phase of the disease but also the pathological condition able to trigger the resolution of the phlogistic event.\\n\\nBased on these findings, we suggest a crucial role of temperature in the modulation of the inflammatory events in MKD patients and suggest strongly considering this variable in future researches aimed at finding a

Molecular targeted therapies have not been widely used for stem cell leukemia\\\/lymphoma (SCLL). Ponatinib (AP24534), which potently inhibits native and mutant BCR-ABL, also targets the FGFR family. Using murine BaF3 cells, stably transformed with six different FGFR1 fusion genes, as well as human KG1 cells expressing activated chimeric FGFR1 and five newly established murine SCLL cell lines, we show that ponatinib (<50 nM) can effectively inhibit phosphoactivation of the fusion kinases and their downstream effectors, such as PLC\\u03b3, Stat5 and Src. Ponatinib also significantly extended survival of mice transplanted with different SCLL cell lines. Ponatinib administered at 30 mg\\\/kg daily also significantly delayed, or even prevented, tumorigenesis of KG1 cells in xenotransplanted mice. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ponatinib specifically inhibits cell growth and clonogenicity of normal human CD34+ progenitor cells transformed by chimeric FGFR1 fusion kinases. Overall, our data provide convincing evidence to suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of FGFR1 fusion kinases with ponatinib is likely to be beneficial for patients with SCLL and perhaps for other human disorders associated with dysregulated FGFR1 activity.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionStem cell leukemia\\\/lymphoma (SCLL), also known as the 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome (EMS), has now been designated \\u2018myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms associated with FGFR1 abnormalities (MLNAF)\\u2019 in the recent WHO classification. MLNAF is characterized by reciprocal chromosome translocations that fuse the FGFR1 kinase domain to a variety of fusion partner genes. These partners provide dimerization domains that facilitate constitutive and ligand-independent activation of the FGFR1 kinase, which leads to a variety of downstream signaling effects involving classical FGFR1 targets such as PLC\\u03b3, members of the Stat family of transcription factors\\u2013 and Src. Currently eleven FGFR1-associated fusion partners have been described, and the most common rearrangement in MLNAF involves a t(8;13)(p11;q11) translocation which fuses ZMYM2 (previously known as ZNF198) with FGFR1 (see review by). We have developed a transduction\\\/transplantation animal model for ZMYM2-FGFR1 which develops myeloproliferative disorder and T-cell lymphoma. The T-cell lymphomas are CD4+\\\/CD8+, have lost T-cell receptor alpha (Tcra) function and show upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes such as Bcl2 and Il2r. In addition, activated mutation of Notch1 was observed in all T-cell lymphomas induced by ZMYM2-FGFR. These observations could explain why the majority of ZMYM2-FGFR1 MLNAF patients develop T-lymphomas, .\\n\\nMLNAF is an aggressive disease, usually presenting with lymphoblastic lymphoma in association with a myeloproliferative disorder, accompanied with\\\/without peripheral eosinophilia. The disorder generally progresses to overt acute myelogenous leukemia within a year of diagnosis\\u2013. The overall mortality rate for MLNAF is >80%, which is significantly higher than in other myeloproliferative disorders, due largely to its aggressive nature and resistance to the current chemotherapy regimens used, which are mostly modified from regimens used for other leukemias\\\/lymphomas. Even allogenic bone marrow transplantation has only a limited associated survival. The molecular characterization of the various aspects of MLNAF, however, offers new targets and we have shown in our in vivo animal studies that targeting Notch with gamma secretase inhibitors, and Src with Dasatinib, has significant efficacy, . The consistent feature of all of the variant fusion kinases, however, is the activation of the FGFR1 kinase, which provides an opportunity to use inhibitors of this function to treat MLNAF.\\n\\nFGFR1 belongs to a large group of protein tyrosine kinases that play crucial roles in controlling cell growth, differentiation and survival, among other functions. There have been two reports describing targeting FGFR1 in MLNAF using either PKC412 or TKI258 . PKC412 (Midostaurin), a multiple serine\\\/threonine and tyrosine kinases inhibitor, was shown to have efficacy in the treatment of one MLNAF patient carrying the ZMYM2-FGFR1 fusion gene. However, it appears that this compound lacks specificity for FGFR activity at the 500 nM (IC50 dose) used. TKI258 (Dovitinib) was shown to specifically inhibit proliferation and survival of the KG1 and KG1A cell lines carrying the FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 chimeric kinase, as well as primary cells from 4 MLNAF patients associated with different FGFR1 rearrangements. Recently, Ponatinib (AP24534), a potent, orally active inhibitor of Bcr-Abl kinase and its mutants, was also shown to be effective against FGFR tyrosine kinase activity at nanomolar concentrations, although not specifically in the context of MLNAF rearrangements. Ponatinib is currently being investigated in a phase II clinical trial for patients with CML (http:\\\/\\\/clinicaltrials.gov NCT01207440). Here we show that Ponatinib effectively inhibited the activation of several different FGFR1 fusion kinases and their downstream effectors, resulting in cell growth inhibition and apoptotic death. In these studies, Ponatinib was more effective than TKI258 in inhibiting in vitro growth of the human MLNAF KG-1 cells. Importantly, Ponatinib treatment resulted in statistically significant prolonged survival in ZMYM2-FGFR1 and CEP110-FGFR1 models of MLNAF in syngeneic transplantation mouse models. Ponatinib was also effective against human KG1 cells in an immunocompromized murine xenotransplantation model. These data indicate that Ponatinib may be effective in the treatment of neoplasms associated with chimeric FGFR1 kinases, and perhaps for other human disorders associated with deregulated FGFR1 activity.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsInhibitorsPonatinib was obtained from Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; PD173074 was obtained from Cayman Chemical; TKI258 (dovitinib) and PKC412 (midostaurin)) were purchased from LC laboratories. All inhibitors were dissolved in DMSO and stored at \\u221280\\u00b0C before use.\\n\\nStable transformation of BaF3 cellsCells from the BaF3 murine pro-B cell line were stably infected with ZMYM2-FGFR1, BCR-FGFR1, CEP110-FGFR1 or the control MIEG3 vector as described previously. Using the same protocol we also established BaF3 cells stably expressing CUX1-FGFR1 (a kind gift from Dr. Els Lierman, Department of human genetics, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium) and FGFROP2-FGFR1 which was cloned from human KG1 cells. The FOP1-FGFR1 fusion gene was synthesized from its individual component parts and fused using a 6 bp linker following PCR amplification. All transformed BaF3 cells co-express GFP and show IL3 growth independence.\\n\\nCell culture and proliferation assaysAll cell lines were cultured in RPMI (Invitrogen) with 5% FBS (Hyclone), at 37\\u00b0C in 10% CO2. For drug treatments, 40,000 cells\\\/well were seeded in 96-well plates and incubated overnight, then treated with the either DMSO (control) or the drugs indicated in the results section at concentrations defined by the experiments. Cell viability was determined using Cell Titer-Glo luminescence cell viability kits (Promega) and a SpectraMaxR M5e (Molecular Probe) luminescence plate reader.\\n\\nCell apoptosis assay and cell cycle analysisFor analysis of apoptosis, cells were stained with Annexin V and 7-AAD (BD Biosciences) following the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol. Cell cycle analysis was performed using standard Flow cytometry procedures following either propidium iodide staining alone, or together with BrdU incorporation. These cells were then stained with anti-BrdU-APC (eBioscience), as described previously .\\n\\nFlow cytometry analysisSpleen tissues were passed through a cell strainer (BD, Bedford, MA) to generate single cell suspensions. Bone marrow cells were isolated by flushing mouse femurs with PBS and stained using specific conjugated monoclonal antibodies (). For intracellular staining of phospho-Stat5, cells were fixed and permeabilized before reacting with a phospho-Stat5 (Y694) antibody (BD Biosciences) according to standard procedures. Following staining, cells were washed once in staining medium and then analyzed using an LSR II cytometer (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR).\\n\\nImmunoprecipitation and western blot analysesProteins were isolated as described previously. Whole-cell lysates (50 \\u03bcg) were separated using SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with specific antibodies (details available on request). To detect phospho-FGFR1, 500 \\u03bcg of each whole-cell lysate was first immunoprecipitated with anti-FGFR1 antibody (Santa Cruze Biotechnology) and followed by Western blot with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20, Sigma).\\n\\nMolecular analysesTotal RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen) and retro-transcribed with a QuantiTect reverse transcription kit (Qiagen). Amplification was performed using standard PCR (New England Bio.) in combination with specific primers and conditions which are available on request.\\n\\nAnimals and treatment scheduleIn the first experiment, female Balb\\\/c mice (Harlan 6\\u20138 weeks old) were injected with ZNF112 or CEP2A cells at 2 \\u00d7 106 per mouse through the tail vein. One week after injection, mice were randomized to treatment with vehicle or Ponatinib (20 mg\\\/kg\\\/day). Ponatinib was dissolved in 25 mM citrate buffer (pH 2.75) according to the manufacturer\\u2019s suggestion, and given orally using a gavage needle twice daily. The control group of mice was given an equal volume of the citrate buffer by gavage. All treatments were performed 6 days per week for 4 weeks. In a second experiment, 5 \\u00d7 106 of KG1 cells\\\/mouse were injected intravenously into female NSG mice (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl\\\/SzJ, Jackson Laboratory). One-week post transplantation these mice were randomly divided into treatment (Ponatinib, n = 9) and control (n = 10) groups. The mice in the Ponatinib group were first treated with 40 mg\\\/kg for 6 days, and following one-week recovery without drug treatment the mice were then switched to 30 mg\\\/kg treatment with a regimen of 4-days-on and 3-days-off for an additional 4 weeks. The control mice were treated as described above. All animal experiments were carried out under protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Georgia Health Sciences University.\\n\\nHistopathologyTissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for at least 48 hours. The sternum bones were decalcified in 6% formic acid for 2\\u20133 days, and then embedded in paraffin. Standard H&E staining was performed using 3 \\u03bcm sections.\\n\\nHuman CD34+ cord blood cell infection and methylcellulose cultureHuman cord blood cells were obtained from the Cord Blood Bank of Georgia Health Sciences University under approved IRB protocols. CD34+ cells were isolated using the EasySep Cord Blood CD34 Positive Selection Kit (StemCell Technologies) following the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol, and expanded in StemSpan SFEM medium (StemCell) supplemented with recombinant human cytokines: LDL 10ug\\\/ml, Flt-3 100ng\\\/ml, SCF 100ng\\\/ml, TPO 50ng\\\/ml, Il-3 20ng\\\/ml and IL6 20ng\\\/ml (R & D Systems). After 24h pre-stimulation, CD34+ cells were infected with either BCR-FGFR1, CEP110-FGFR1 or the control MIEG3 vector as described previously. After four rounds of infection, the infected cells were treated with either DMSO or 50 nM Ponatinib (BCR-FGFR1 infected CD34+ cells were treated with 100 nM) for 48 h in the growth medium, and then plated into methylcellulose media (MethoCult H4435, StemCell Technologies) at 1500 cell\\\/well in 12-well plates. Each treatment was triplicated and colonies were counted and classified under a microscope at 50x magnification.\\n\\nResultsTo investigate whether Ponatinib inhibits proliferation in cells expressing various FGFR1-chimeric kinases in vitro, we infected BaF3 cells with retroviral constructs and selected pools of IL3 independent cells. This assay has been used extensively to establish whether exogenous genes have oncogenic abilities. Cells transformed with human ZMYM2-FGFR1, BCR-FGFR1, CEP110-FGFR1, FGFR1OP2-FGFR1, FOP-FGFR1 and CUX1-FGFR1, grew rapidly and demonstrated auto activation of the various fusion kinases.\\n\\nPonatinib inhibits chimeric FGFR1 transformed cell growth at nanomolar concentrationsUsing the Cell Titre-Glo assay, Ponatinib was shown to proportionally reduce cell growth at various IC50 values, ranging from 20 to 50 nM in BaF3 cells expressing the various fusion kinases. Cells infected with the empty MIEG3 vector and maintained on IL3, were not affected by Ponatinib up to 100 nM (). Thus, Ponatinib clearly has a profound effect on the ability of the FGFR1 fusion kinases to promote cell growth in this model system.\\n\\nPreviously we developed a series of cell lines from primary MLNAF for three of the variant fusion kinases. ZNF112 expresses the ZMYM-FGFR1, BBC1 and BBC2 express BCR-FGFR1 and CEP2A and CEP5A carry CEP110-FGFR1. ZNF112, CEP2A and CEP5A were derived from T-cell lymphomas, while BBC1 and BBC2 were derived from B-cell lymphomas. Ponatinib also inhibits proliferation of these murine MLNAF cell lines (), where IC50 values ranged between 10\\u201320 nM for ZNF112, CEP2A and CEP5A and 20\\u201350 nM for BBC1\\\/2. These data demonstrate that Ponatinib is also effective against cells derived from the primary MLNAF disease.\\n\\nPonatinib induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and death associated with a decrease of chimeric FGFR1 phosphorylationWhen Ponatinib was used to treat BaF3 cell pools stably expressing ZMYM2-FGFR1 and CEP110-FGFR1 (50 nM) or BCR-FGFR1 (100 nM) for 48 h, reduced phosphorylation FGFR1 levels was seen (). The percentage of cells in S-phase was also dramatically decreased, while the percentage of apoptotic cells was increased in the three different chimeric kinase-transformed BaF3 cells () which suggests that their survival depends on activated FGFR1. When four murine MLNAF cell lines were treated with 50 nM Ponatinib for 48 h, similar results were seen, except for BBC2 cells, which required 100 nM Ponatinib. The effects on S-phase and apoptosis correlated with decreased levels of phosphoactivation of the chimeric kinases in all MLNAF cell lines ().\\n\\nPonatinib inhibited downstream molecular components of chimeric FGFR1We next analyzed known consequences of FGFR1 activation following Ponatinib treatment of the derivative BaF3 and MLNAF cell lines. PLC\\u03b3 is a well-known downstream target of FGFR1 and we have previously demonstrated that constitutive expression of FGFR1 chimeric kinases increases Src activation. In this analysis we also compared the effects of Ponatinib inhibition of FGFR1 with those of Dasatinib inhibition of Src. In transformed BaF3 cells, Ponatinib showed significant effects on PLC\\u03b3 activation, whereas Dasatinib generally did not (). Both Dasatinib and Ponatinib treatment, however, led to an almost complete loss of Src activation, which is consistent with a direct effect of Dasatinib on Src activation, as well as Src being a downstream consequence of FGFR1 activation. Phosphoactivated Stat5 is increased in FGFR1 chimeric kinase expressing cells and when the murine MLNAF cell lines were treated Ponatinib pStat5 levels were also decreased. In the MLNAF cell lines, Ponatinib remarkably reduced pPLC\\u03b3 and pSrc levels in all cases. Similarly, pStat5 levels were beyond the limits of detection in all but BBC2 ().\\n\\nPonatinib significantly reduces leukemogenesis in vivoThe in vitro studies described above suggested that Ponatinib is potentially an effective single agent against chimeric FGFR1 expressing cells. To determine whether the same was true in vivo, we grafted ZNF112 and CEP2A cells into syngeneic mice which we have previously shown results in MLNAF (and unpublished observations). Control animals were treated with vehicle, and the experimental mice were treated with 20 mg\\\/kg Ponatinib for 4 weeks following the regimen described in the Methods. The mean survival time in the control groups of ZNF112 and CEP2A mice was 28 and 35 days, respectively (). In Ponatinib treated ZNF112 cohorts survival averaged 76 days (p = 0.0001) and mice engrafted with CEP2A survived on average 62 days (p = 0.006). Three mice in both groups were still alive after 160 days when the experiment was terminated. Consistently, the mean spleen weight in the Ponatinib treated group was significantly (p < 0.05) less than in the vehicle treated group in both ZNF112 and CEP2A transplanted mouse models ().\\n\\nPonatinib induces growth inhibition and apoptosis in human KG1 cellsTo date, there have been no reported human cell lines carrying the common FGFR1 chimeric kinases, although the KG1 cell line, originally described as being derived from an AML patient, expresses the rare FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 variant. KG1 cells show constitutive activation of the chimeric FGFR1 protein, suggesting that the original patient probably suffered from MLNAF. Cell proliferation assays demonstrated an IC50 of ~20 nM for KG1 cells (), which is similar to that seen for all of the murine MLNAF cell lines analyzed, with the exception of those expressing BCR-FGFR1 (). Consistent with this observation, Ponatinib also decreased the phosphorylation levels of FGFR1OP2-FGFR1, and its downstream effectors, at a low 25 nM dose (). By comparison, although another FGFR1 inhibitor, TKI258, was active against the chimeric FGFR1 kinase in KG1 cells, a ~10-fold higher concentration was required to achieve the same effect (). To further compare the relative efficacy between TKI258 and Ponatinib, we used different doses of the two drugs to treat KG1 cells in vitro for 24 h and observed that both drugs reduced FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 phosphorylation levels in a dose-dependent manner, as well as the phosphoactivation of its downstream effectors, such as pPLC\\u03b3, and pSrc (). Using quantitative Phosphoflow analysis (), 25 nM Ponatinib treatment resulted in a marked reduction in pStat5 activation, whereas the same response required 250 nM of TKI258. This 10-fold difference in active concentration was also reflected in the proportional decrease in activation of the downstream targets pPLC\\u03b3 and pSrc ().\\n\\nTo determine the consequences of inactivating FGFR1 function using both kinase inhibitors, we demonstrated that 14.1% of cells exhibited apoptosis after treatment with 25 nM Ponatinib over a 72 hour period, whereas 500 nM TKI258 was required to achieve the same response (). While this level of apoptosis is relatively low, it is three times that seen in cells treated with the vehicle alone. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that after 72 h treatment with 25 nM Ponatinib, 88% of KG1 cells were in G0\\\/G1. Treatment with 250 nM TKI258 resulted in 72% of cells arrested in G0\\\/G1, even though TKI258 at this concentration does not induce significant apoptosis in KG1 cells (). As shown in , however, 250 nM TKI258 did not completely prevent activation of the chimeric FGFR1, PLC\\u03b3 or pSrc. It seems, therefore, that residual, low levels of FGFR1 kinase activity can protect the cells from undergoing apoptosis.\\n\\nPonatinib significantly prolongs survival of mice xenotransplanted with KG1 cellsPonatinib treatment can significantly prolong survival in the murine MLNAF model described above, although it is important to determine whether human cells are similarly affected in vivo. We, therefore, investigated the anti-tumorigenic activity of Ponatinib using KG1 cells in a xenotransplant mouse model. Previous studies of KG1 cells have predominantly used subcutaneous xenografts\\u2013, so we first investigated whether we could establish an orthotopic xenograft model that is more representative of leukemia. We therefore injected 3 female NSG mice intravenously with 5 \\u00d7 106 KG1 cells. After 40\\u201360 days all these animals succumbed to the disease, demonstrating hypercellularity in the bone marrow, infiltrates into the lungs and kidneys () as well as intra-abdominal tumors (where > 90% of cells were positive for human CD45, data not shown). The spleens, however, were only slightly enlarged. To enrich for cells that were more prone to homing to the bone marrow microenvironment, we recovered the KG1 cells from the BM of these mice and expanded them in vitro. The immunophenotype of these recovered KG1 cells are identical to the parental cells, and protein expression level of FGFR1OP2-FGFR1 was also the same (data not shown). To determine the effect of Ponatinib on the disease produced by these reselected cells, we injected 5 \\u00d7 106\\\/mouse intravenously into NSG mice. One-week post transplantation the mice were randomly divided into treatment and control groups. The treatment group (n = 9) were originally orally dosed with 40 mg\\\/kg per day, but after only one week of treatment they exhibited an obvious decrease in body weight. We therefore suspended the treatment for one week and then on resumption of the treatment, reduced the dose to 30 mg\\\/kg following an interrupted regimen of 4-days-on and 3-days-off for an additional 4 weeks. In this study, the mice treated with 30 mg\\\/kg Ponatinib showed a significantly longer survival time than mice from the control group. Significantly, 44% of the treated mice are still alive after 4-months post-transplantation (). Consistent with this observation, flow cytometry analysis, using anti-human CD45 antibodies, demonstrated that there were remarkably fewer KG1 cells in the bone marrows and spleens from the Ponatinib treated mice compared to the control mice (). Furthermore, histopathological analysis showed that mice in the control group showed hypercellularity in bone marrow and extensive infiltration of KG1 cells into the lungs and livers. In contrast, in the Ponatinib treated mice, a normal cytoarchitecture of these organs was observed (). These experiments, therefore, demonstrate that treatment with Ponatinib alone can significantly reduce leukemogenesis both in the murine MLNAF model as well as in human KG1 xenotransplanted mice, further indicating a potential chemotherapeutic role for Ponatinib in MLNAF patients.\\n\\nPonatinib specifically inhibits cell growth and clonogenicity of normal human CD34+ progenitor cells transformed by chimeric FGFR1 fusion kinasesThe studies presented above demonstrate that Ponatinib is effective in treating cells expressing FGFR1 fusion kinases in MLNAF models. Testing its efficacy in the human disease, however, is difficult because of the rarity of MLNAF. To overcome this challenge, we sorted normal human cord blood CD34+ progenitor cells and infected them with retroviral supernatant carrying either CEP110-FGFR1, BCR-FGFR1 or control MIEG3 vector. After four rounds of infection, the average infection efficiency was shown to be >60% as determined by flow cytometry analysis of GFP+ cells (). To determine whether Ponatinib was effective against these human cells, we compared transformed CD34+ cells with those carrying the empty vector following treatment for 48h. The concentration of Ponatinib used in these experiments were based on the BaF3 cell model system described above. Flow cytometry analyses demonstrated that 50 nM Ponatinib did not change the percentage of GFP+ cells in empty vector infected cells (), but significantly (p < 0.01) decreased the GFP+ population cells in the CD34+ cells transformed with either CEP110-FGFR1 or BCR-FGFR1 (). In addition, Ponatinib treatment induced increased apoptosis in the FGFR1 fusion gene transformed CD34+ cells compared with the MIEG3 infected cells (). Together these experiments demonstrated that human FGFR1 fusion kinase-transformed cells are sensitive to Ponatinib. To determine whether Ponatinib could specifically block differentiation of CD34+ progenitor cells, we seeded transformed or MIEG3 infected cells into semi-solid methycellulose medium. The cells were pre-treated with Ponatinib or DMSO for 48 h, and cultured with the full complement of growth factors (see Methods) for 9 days. The specific types of colonies (erythroid, granular cell, myeloid cell or granulocyte\\\/macrophage) and numbers of colonies were classified and counted under a microscope. Since in this analysis, Ponatinib did not have any effect on the types of colonies formed, all lineage-specific colonies were pooled as shown in . Ponatinib significantly reduced the colony formation efficacy of both CEP110-FGFR1 and BCR-FGFR1 transformed CD34+ cells, but not in MIEG3 infected CD34+ cells at 50 nM concentrations. In summary, Ponatinib, by targeting FGFR1 kinase activity, specifically inhibits cell proliferation in chimeric FGFR1 transformed cells and further induced these cells to undergo apoptosis. Compared to other FGFR1 inhibitors, therefore, it appears that Ponatinib may be a more potent FGFR1 inhibitor that merits further evaluation in MLNAF patients, as well as in other FGFR1 dependent solid tumors.\\n\\nDiscussionAll patients reported to date with MLNAF carry a chimeric FGFR1 kinase, suggesting that constitutive activation of this kinase is the primary initiating event, although it appears that other genetic events are required for disease development, , . Sustained function of the chimeric kinase, however, appears to be required to maintain cell viability, since inactivating its function with various drugs reduces cell survival. Previous studies, for example, have shown that PKC412 (midostaurin) and TKI258 (dovitinib) increases growth inhibition of FGFR1-transformed BaF3 cells and human leukemic KG1 cells, . Proliferation of primary MLNAF cells was also inhibited by TKI258. In one ZMYM2-FGFR1 patient with advanced disease, treatment with PKC412 induced a partial response, but recent data suggests that this compound lacks specificity for FGFR activity at the 500 nM (IC50 dose) used. Despite these indications of efficacy against MLNAF, there is clearly a need to examine other compounds that can more efficiently target FGFR1 activity. Although Ponatinib, which is an orally active, multitargeted kinase inhibitor was originally developed for treatment of both refractory and mutant BCR-ABL-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), analysis of the spectrum of kinases that were also down regulated showed that FGFR kinases were inhibited at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, Ponatinib effectively inhibited KG1 cell growth in vitro. These observations prompted us to investigate whether it could be also used as a therapeutic agent to treat MLNAF. In both the human disease, and murine models of MLNAF, there is evidence that, although MPD is the common component of the syndrome, the specific leukemia\\\/lymphoma (T-cell or B-cell) that develops depends to some extent on the specific individual variant chimeric kinase that is expressed. Some patients presented coincidently with bilineage (myeloid and lymphoid) neoplasms. These observations, therefore, suggest that targeting the genetic abnormality that is common to all of the variant diseases in the syndrome would be the most successful. Indeed, we found that Ponatinib can efficiently inhibit both MLNAF lymphoid cells and human myeloid KG1 cells in vitro as well as in vivo. The effective dose of Ponatinib required in these experiments was 5\\u201310 times lower than TKI258, which is consistent with results from Gozgit et al. in BaF3 cells engineered to express constitutively activated versions of each of the 4 FGFRs. Similarly, in mouse models of MLNAF, Ponatinib (20 mg\\\/kg) was also shown more effective than the 100 mg\\\/kg described for PKC412, which is also consistent with our in vitro experiment treating ZNF112 cells with PKC412, which was 10-fold less effective in inducing the same level of cell growth inhibition seen for Ponatinib. Overall, these observations provide preclinical evidence that Ponatinib may prove more effective than other FGFR1 inhibitors as part of a treatment strategy for MLNAF.\\n\\nDespite the significant effect of Ponatinib against FGFR1 kinase function in vitro, in vivo treatment showed a limited success. At the 30 mg\\\/Kg dose used in our experiments, it was calculated that Ponatinib can reach a mean plasma level of 561 nM, 6-hours after oral administration, which is 10\\u201320 times greater than the IC50 values noted in MLNAF cells in vitro. Despite this, only 20% of mice with xenografts of murine MLNAF survived, and 40% of mice with xenografted KG1 cells showed long term survival after Ponatinib treatment. It should be noted that this survival rate might have been prolonged if the treatment had been extended beyond 4 weeks. These studies clearly suggest that molecularly targeting a single oncogene\\\/pathway may not be sufficient to prevent disease progression, especially if resistant clones frequently arise after long-term treatment with a single agent. Previous studies, ,  showed that leukemia\\\/lymphoma induced by ZMYM2-FGFR1 was oligoclonal, suggesting that additional events, genetic or epigenetic, are required for development and progression of FGFR1-driven leukemogenesis. We previously demonstrated that the consistent deletion of the T-cell receptor alpha (Tcra) gene, as well as mutational activation of Notch1 are required for ZMYM2\\u2013FGFR1 driven murine T-ALL. Treatment of these T-ALL with GSIs showed some efficacy. We have also shown that upregulation of Bcl2 and activation of PI3K are common events in MLNAF, and consequently targeting these proteins has a significant effect on cell viability in vitro (data not shown). It is possible, therefore, that combining drugs against all of these targets may have greater success in treatment of this disease.\\n\\nDuring our in vivo experiments in the NSG mice, we observed that daily oral dosing with 40 mg\\\/kg Ponatinib caused remarkable loss of body weight and ruffled fur in all treated mice after only one-week. After interrupting the treatment for one-week the mice recovered, and then we continued to administer the drug at 30 mg\\\/kg using a 4-days-on\\\/3-days-off regimen where the drug appeared to be better tolerated. O\\u2019Hare and colleagues reported that Ponatinib showed a wide therapeutic range (5\\u201350mg\\\/kg) which was well tolerated in both SCID and Nude mouse models, although the NSG mice seemed to be more sensitive. In contrast, we did not observe side-effects of Ponatinib treatment (20 mg\\\/kg) in Balb\\\/c mice xenotransplanted with ZNF112 or CEP2A. This increased sensitivity in the NSG mice may be due to their extreme immunodeficiency (absence of mature T, B, and natural killer cells) compared with SCID (lack of T and B cells) and Nude mice (greatly reduced number of T cells).\\n\\nIn conclusion, we provide convincing evidence that Ponatinib can effectively inhibit phosphorylation levels of the various FGFR1 fusion kinases, and their downstream effectors, which subsequently led to cell growth inhibition and death. Consistent with these in vitro studies, short term exposure to Ponatinib can significantly extend survival of mice xenografted with different chimeric FGFR1-driven leukemias in vivo, as well as cell growth and colony formation efficacy of human CD34+ progenitor cells transformed with chimeric FGFR1 kinases. These results provide a proof-of-principle that molecularly targeting cells expressing chimeric FGFR1 kinases with the novel FGFR1 inhibitor Ponatinib could be a potentially successful approach to the treatment of MLNAF patients, either alone or in combination with other drugs, such as those targeting Src or the Notch1 signaling pathway.\\n\\nSupplementary Material1\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"ponatinib\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"FGFR1\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Interaction\":\"ponatinib results in decreased phosphorylation of and results in decreased activity of FGFR1 protein mutant form\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^activity|decreases^phosphorylation\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"ponatinib\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"FGFR1\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Interaction\":\"ponatinib inhibits the reaction [FGFR1 protein mutant form results in increased phosphorylation of SRC protein]\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^reaction|increases^phosphorylation\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"ponatinib\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"SRC\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Interaction\":\"ponatinib inhibits the reaction [FGFR1 protein mutant form results in increased phosphorylation of SRC protein]\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^reaction|increases^phosphorylation\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"ponatinib\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"ABL1\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"ponatinib results in decreased activity of ABL1 protein mutant form\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^activity\"}]"}]}

The chemical is converted into 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide and gives rise to three main DNA adducts, N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4AQO, 3-(desoxyguanosin-N (2)-yl)-4AQO and 3-(deoxyadenosin-N (6)-yl)-4AQO. This study was designed to assess the shape of the dose-response curve at low concentrations of 4NQO in three human lymphoblastoid cell lines, MCL-5, AHH-1 and TK6 as well as the mouse lymphoma L5178Y cell line in vitro. Chromosomal damage was investigated using the in vitro micronucleus assay, while further gene mutation and DNA damage studies were carried out using the hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase forward mutation and comet assays. 4NQO showed little to no significant increases in micronucleus induction in the human lymphoblastoid cell lines, even up to 55\\u00b15% toxicity. A dose-response relationship could only be observed in the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y after 4NQO treatment, even at concentrations with no reduction in cell viability. Further significant increases in gene mutation and DNA damage induction were observed. Hence, 4NQO is a more effective point mutagen than clastogen, and its suitability as a positive control for genotoxicity testing has to be evaluated for every individual assay.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionGenetic toxicology involves the assessment of a substance\\u2019s ability to induce DNA damage, which is an essential consideration for human health risk assessment because DNA damage is an underlying cause of mutations that have the potential to initiate carcinogenesis. It is essential to investigate and understand the biological significance of genotoxic effects of chemicals at the low-dose exposure range to improve human health risk assessment and to establish if DNA reactive compounds follow linear or non-linear dose\\u2013response relationships.\\n\\nTraditionally, high concentrations of genotoxins were used in in vitro testing to ensure that DNA damaging effects were identified and because of the assumption that genotoxins follow a linear relationship that was extrapolated back to the low-dose region (). However, in recent years, the linear model was challenged (), and it became apparent that inappropriately high concentration in genetic toxicology testing was responsible for many of the false-positive results in Stage 1 in vitro testing (,). In vitro genetic toxicity assays have been extensively used in safety assessment studies and have contributed to our understanding of the dose\\u2013response relationships of aneugens, clastogens and point mutagens (). Genotoxicants can interact with DNA by various mechanisms, such as direct interaction of the compound with DNA, interaction of the compound with cellular components that cause indirect DNA damage and DNA damage can also be induced through activation of the compound by cellular metabolism to produce products, which are capable to subsequently interact with DNA ().\\n\\n4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4NQO) is a known mutagen and carcinogen and is therefore used in various genotoxicity assays as a positive control (). The chemical was first synthesised in 1942, and its carcinogenicity was first demonstrated in 1957 (,). Since then, 4NQO has widely been used in experimental oncology as a potent carcinogen (). It is known that 4NQO induces cancer in various tissues in mice and rat, examples of which are lung, pancreas and stomach (). Chemically, 4NQO is comprised of two polar groups, the N-oxide and nitro group. It is therefore susceptible to nucleophilic attack in chemical reactions (). The enzymatic reduction of its nitro group is believed to cause 4NQO\\u2019s carcinogenic effect. 4NQO is converted into 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline 1-oxide (4HAQO) and 4-aminoquinoline 1-oxide (4AQO); however, only 4HAQO is believed to be carcinogenic (). 4NQO and its reduced metabolite 4HAQO are able to bind to cellular macromolecules, such as nucleic acid and protein (). The activated 4HAQO gives rise to three main adducts by reacting with purines, but not with pyrimidines (); of these adducts, two are located within the guanine base and another adenine adduct is also formed. The structures of adducts identified were nucleic acid bases, nucleosides or nucleotides of N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-4AQO, 3-(desoxyguanosin-N\\n2-yl)-4AQO and 3-(deoxyadenosin-N\\n6-yl)-4AQO (,). The dGuo-C8-AQO adduct results from an attack of the nitrenium ion on the C8 position of guanine, whereas the dGuo-N2-AQO and the dAdo-N6-AQO adducts results from a carbocation attack on the guanine N2 and the adenine N6 positions, respectively (). It is known that 4NQO reacts primarily with DNA at the N2 and C8 position of guanine and to a smaller extent at the N6 position of adenine (). Further, 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG) formation has been reported in cellular DNA treated with 4NQO (,), and it has been shown that 4NQO also induces oxidative stress and generates reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide radicals or hydrogen peroxide (,).\\n\\nThis study was designed to assess the shape of the dose\\u2013response curve at low concentrations of 4NQO in human and mouse cells in vitro and to investigate the effects of using different study designs on the points of departure (PoD) and genotoxic potency. Chromosomal damage was investigated using the in vitro micronucleus (MN) assay, while further gene mutation and DNA damage studies were carried out using the hypoxanthine\\u2013guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) forward mutation and comet assays. Comparative studies were performed in two laboratories, Swansea University, Swansea, UK and AstraZeneca, UK.\\n\\nMaterials and methodsTest agent4NQO was acquired from Sigma\\u2013Aldrich (Dorset, UK) and dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO; Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, UK). Before use, the chemical was freshly diluted from a stock solution (2.5mg\\\/ml aliquots at Swansea University and 0.019mg\\\/ml aliquots at AstraZeneca) with DMSO.\\n\\nCell lines and culture conditionsAt Swansea University, the human lymphoblastoid cell lines, MCL-5, AHH-1 and TK6, were utilised. AHH-1 is a human lymphoblastoid TK+\\\/\\u2212 cell line that constitutively expresses a high level of native CYP1A1 (). AHH-1 cells carry a heterozygous mutation in the TP53 locus (). The human lymphoblastoid cell line MCL-5 is derived from AHH-1 by stable transfection with human cytochromes (CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP3A4 and CYP2E1) and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (). These cytochromes and a hygromycin B resistance gene are carried as cDNAs in plasmids incorporated into the cell. Further, MCL-5 cells carry, like AHH-1 cells, a heterozygous mutation in the TP53 locus. The human lymphoblastoid cell line TK6 is a derivative of the WIL-2 cell line and contains the wild-type TP53 gene. For the experiments carried out at AstraZeneca, TK6 and the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y were used. L5178Y cells are known for their dysfunctional p53 activity (,). TK6 cells showed a composite karyotype of 47 XY, +der3t(3,21), +der13t(13,22) and \\u221214+der14t(14,20), while L5178Y cells showed a composite karyotype of 40 X0 der5t(5,15), der9t(9,6) Robertsonian fusion 12 and 13, del 14+15(t15,5), +15(t15,18,14), der15, \\u221215q and der 18t(18,6).\\n\\nThe average doubling time of TK6 cells in both laboratories was ~16 to 18h. The doubling time of AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells was ~22 to 24h, whereas the L5178Y doubling time was ~11.5h.\\n\\nAt Swansea University, all cell lines were cultured in RPMI 1640 (GibCo\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) supplemented with 10% donor horse serum (BD Gentest, Oxford, UK) and 1% l-glutamine (GibCo\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Cells were maintained at 37\\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. For MCL-5 cells, hygromycin B (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in acetic acid (35mM) was added at each passage to a final concentration of 200 \\u00b5g\\\/ml to ensure plasmid retention ().\\n\\nTK6 cells at AstraZeneca were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma\\u2013Aldrich, Dorset, UK) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor horse serum (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 2mM l-glutamine (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 2mM sodium pyruvate (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 200 IU\\\/ml penicillin (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) and 200 \\u00b5g\\\/ml streptomycin (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2. L5178Y cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated donor horse serum, 2mM l-glutamine, 2mM sodium pyruvate, 1% Pluronic F68 (Gibco\\u00ae Invitrogen, Paisley, UK), 200 IU\\\/ml penicillin and 200 \\u00b5g\\\/ml streptomycin at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2.\\n\\nTreatment with test agentFor the in vitro cytokinesis-block micronucleus (CBMN) assay, AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells were treated with 4NQO over a range of concentrations up to 0.7 \\u00b5g\\\/ml for 4h, followed by one cell cycle of cytochalasin B (4.5 \\u00b5g\\\/ml for MCL-5 cells; 6 \\u00b5g\\\/ml for AHH-1 cells). TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO over a range of concentrations up to 0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml for 4, 24 or 48h, respectively, followed by one cell cycle of cytochalasin B (4.5 \\u00b5g\\\/ml). Further, TK6 cells were treated for 24h with 4NQO for the HPRT assay study with 0.0009, 0.003, 0.01 and 0.02 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4NQO. Medium was used as negative control, whereas DMSO was used as the solvent control. The experiments were carried out in triplicate.\\n\\nFor the mononucleated in vitro MN assay, L5178Y cells were treated with 4NQO for 4h, followed by 24-h recovery time over a range of concentrations up to 0.05 \\u00b5g\\\/ml. Further, TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO for 4h plus 40-h recovery period and 24h plus 24-h recovery time over a range of concentrations up to 0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml. For the comet assay, TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO for 3h over a range of concentrations up to 0.06 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4NQO because of previous experiments conducted at AstraZeneca (data not shown). The experiments were carried out in duplicate.\\n\\nThe treatment regimes chosen covered a range from producing 55\\u00b15% cytotoxicity to little or no toxicity, as higher levels may induce chromosome damage as a secondary effect of cytotoxicity ().\\n\\nThe in vitro MN assayThe CBMN assay was carried out at Swansea University. Ten-millilitre cell suspensions were seeded at 1\\u00d7105 cells\\\/ml for 24h at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2 prior to treatment. Details of the assay are described by Br\\u00fcsehafer et al. ().\\n\\nThe in vitro MN test (mononucleated assay) procedure routinely performed at AstraZeneca used the semi-automated MN scoring system Metafer (MetaSystems, Germany). Ten-millilitre cell suspensions were seeded at 2\\u00d7105 cells\\\/ml and immediately treated with 1% v\\\/v solvent control and the test chemical at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2. After the different incubation times, all of the cell suspensions were removed from each flask and transferred into appropriately labelled tubes. The cells were centrifuged (5min, 200 \\u00d7 g), the supernatant was discarded and the pellets washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), before re-suspending the cells in 10-ml fresh media. The cells were cytospun onto polished glass slides. Shandon mega-funnels (8min, 1000rpm) were used to harvest cells for the Metafer System. The cells were fixed in 100% methanol for 15min. For the semi-automated scoring protocol, the cells were stained for 10min with a 4\\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole + vectashield (Vector Lab., Inc., UK) solution and scanned with the Metafer4 software. All experiments carried out at AstraZeneca were run in duplicate. One thousand mononucleated cells were scored per replicate.\\n\\nCytotoxicity and cytostasisRelative population doubling (RPD) was used to measure cytotoxicity and cytostasis in the absence of cytochalasin B. Therefore, satellite cultures were seeded as described previously for the CBMN assay (). Cells were counted with the Beckman coulter counter (Z1 Coulter\\u00ae Particle Counter, Beckman, UK) 1h before treatment (control cultures) and at the cell harvest stage (treated cultures).\\n\\nRPD was calculated as follows:\\n\\nRPD=Number\\u2009of\\u2009population\\u2009doublings\\u2009in\\u2009treated\\u2009culturesNumber\\u2009of\\u2009population\\u2009doublings\\u2009in\\u2009control\\u2009cultures\\u00d7100where\\n\\nPopulation\\u2009doubling=[log\\u2009(post-treatment\\u2009cell\\u2009number\\\/initial\\u2009cell\\u2009number)]Log\\u20092The HPRT gene mutation assayThe first step of the HPRT assay was the mutant cleansing stage to remove background mutants within the TK6 cell population. Therefore, hypoxanthine\\u2013aminopterin\\u2013thymidine (HAT) was added to the TK6 culture (4\\u20135\\u00d7105 cells\\\/ml), and the cells were grown for 3 days. After 3 days, the HAT medium was washed off with PBS. Afterwards, the cells were re-suspended in 50-ml fresh medium, and hypoxanthine\\u2013thymidine (HT) was added to the culture medium for 24h. After washing off the HT medium with PBS, TK6 cell suspensions were seeded at 1\\u00d7105 cells\\\/ml for 24h at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2. The cell suspensions were then treated with 4NQO, and after the treatment period, 4NQO was then washed off with PBS, new medium was added and the cells were sub-cultured to 1.2\\u20131.5\\u00d7105 cells\\\/ml in 50-ml flasks (Day 1). The cells were sub-cultured and left to grow for 13 days in total to enable expression of the HPRT\\u2212 mutants. Cells were sub-cultured at Days 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11. After the phenotypic expression period at day 13, the cells were added to 96-well micro plates.\\n\\nFor mutant frequency, TK6 cells with 2.4\\u00d7107 cells in 60ml were treated with 240 \\u00b5l of 6-thioguanine (0.6 \\u00b5g\\\/ml) (6-TK) for selection. Five plates per dose were used with 100 \\u00b5l of cell suspension in each well. Plates were scored for colony formation after 14 days of continuous incubation at 37\\u00b0C, 5%CO2. Scoring criteria specified that only colonies with 20+ cells in diameter were scored. Further, it was ensured that separate colonies were clearly apart, taking clonal expansion into account. These experiments were carried using three separate stock solutions, but with the same cell passage.\\n\\nThe in vitro comet assay +\\\/\\u2212hOGG1For the in vitro comet assay, TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO that was then washed off with PBS and the cells were re-suspended in fresh media. The cell number was adjusted to 1.5\\u00d7105 cells\\\/ml. After that, 1ml of the cell suspensions were sampled into labelled Eppendorf tubes and washed with 1ml cold 1\\u00d7 PBS. After centrifugation, the supernatant was removed from the pellet and the cells were re-suspended with 200-\\u00b5l low-melting agarose and 3\\u00d740 \\u00b5l drops, resulting in three gels, were added per glass slide (pre-coated with 0.5% agarose) and covered with a coverslip. Slides were then placed on a cold tray, which allowed for gels to set after which the coverslips were removed and the slides were placed in cold lysis solution [2.5M NaCl, 100mM disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate dihydrate (Na2EDTA), 10mM Tris buffer (pH 10), 10% DMSO, 1% Triton X-100] in a dark container over night at 4\\u00b0C. Following lysis, the slides were washed twice for 5min in 1\\u00d7 buffer F [40mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 0.1M KCl, 0.5mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and 0.2mg\\\/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 8.0)] at room temperature. hOGG1 (+hOGG1) or buffer F (\\u2212hOGG1) (60 \\u00b5l) were then added to each slide, topped up with a coverslip and incubated in a humidified box at 37\\u00b0C for 10min. After removing the coverslips, the slides were placed in an electrophoresis platform and covered with electrophoresis buffer [1mM Na2EDTA, 0.3M NaOH (pH 13)] for 20min at 4\\u00b0C to allow the DNA to unwind. Afterwards, the electrophoresis was performed at 0.7V\\\/cm, 300 mA for further 20min at 4\\u00b0C. To neutralise, the slides were removed from the electrophoresis platform and immersed in three changes of neutralisation buffer [0.4M Tris\\u2013HCl (pH 7.5)] for 5min each time at room temperature. Finally, the slides were stained with 60-\\u00b5l propidium iodide (20 \\u00b5g\\\/ml) for 30min, before scoring using a Comet IV capture system (Perceptive Instruments Ltd., Haverhill, UK). Fifty nuclei per gel were scored and the tail intensity that is defined as the percentage of DNA migrated from the head of the comet into the tail was measured for each nucleus scored (). The experiment was run in duplicate.\\n\\nData analysisError bars are represented as standard deviation of the mean. Student\\u2019s paired t-test (n = 2) or a one-way analysis of variance approach (n = 3), followed by a two-sided Dunnett\\u2019s post hoc test with log-transformed data based on Kolmogorov\\u2013Smirnov test for normality and Bartlett\\u2019s test for homogeneity of variance (), were used to determine if any of the treatment concentrations were significantly different from the control. BM dose (BMD) approach with covariate analysis was carried out to assess the MN data. BMD values were derived using the dose\\u2013response modelling software package PROAST version 50.8, using covariate analysis to improve precision and provide information on potency (,; G. E. Johnson et al., in preparation).\\n\\nResults4NQO is used as a positive control in various in vitro genotoxicity assays because of its known mutagenic and carcinogenic properties. The aim of this study was to investigate the low dose\\u2013response relationships of 4NQO in human lymphoblastoid cells to calculate and compare PoDs for genotoxic activity. The chosen exposure and recovery times were optimised using empirical experiments bearing in mind the need to keep cytotoxicity levels below 55\\u00b15% as dying cells can confound the MN assay results.\\n\\nChromosome damage induction in p53 compromised MCL-5 and AHH-1 cells and the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178YTo evaluate if 4NQO requires metabolic activation and to investigate the role of p53 proficiency, the metabolically competent human cell line MCL-5 and the parent cell line AHH-1, which holds some degree of metabolic competence, were treated with 4NQO at Swansea University. Both these cell lines have a heterozygous p53 mutation in codon 282. At AstraZeneca, the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y (with dysfunctional p53 function) was treated with 4NQO. L5178Y cells are frequently used for genetic toxicity studies. Short-term treatments with and without prolonged recovery times were used for the investigation. AHH-1 cells treated with 4NQO for 4h over a range of concentration up to 0.7 \\u00b5g\\\/ml, followed by one cell cycle of cytochalasin B (22h) showed significant increases in MN induction only at 0.3 \\u00b5g\\\/ml. However, MCL-5 cells showed no significant increases in MN induction for the short-term treatment over the range of concentrations chosen. At 0.7 \\u00b5g\\\/ml, high toxicity levels were observed in AHH-1 and MCL-5 (61% in AHH-1 and 53.5% in MCL-5) cells (). L5178Y cells were treated with 4NQO for 4h followed by a prolonged recovery time of 24h (two cell cycles) prior to harvesting, over a concentration range up to 0.05 \\u00b5g\\\/ml. The average doubling time of L5178Y cell was 11.5h, hence they grow much faster than the other cell lines used. The cells showed significant increases in MN induction at the lowest concentration selected (0.005 \\u00b5g\\\/ml) and above. No reduction in cell viability could be observed over the range of concentrations tested (). The experiments showed that 4NQO required no metabolic activation to induce chromosomal damage.\\n\\nFigure 1.Effect of 4NQO on AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells using the in vitro CBMN assay.

Values represent mean and range of duplicate experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (Student\\u2019s paired t-test).\\n\\nThe dose responses were further assessed by using BMD modelling with covariate analysis in PROAST version 50.8 (; supplementary Figure 1, available at Mutagenesis Online). BMD modelling utilises a set of statistical models to estimate a defined increase above its control response values (benchmark response), along with its confidence limits. For the AHH-1 data after treatment with 4NQO, a BMD10 (10% increase above the background) was calculated at 0.1238 \\u03bcg\\\/ml with confidence intervals between 0.0678 and 0.3007 \\u03bcg\\\/ml, respectively. No dose response was observed for the MCL-5 data; however, the covariate approach enabled the derivation of BMD10 and BMDL10 metrics at 46.4590 and 0.2120, respectively, along with an infinite BMDU10. The L5178Y data set revealed a BMD10 at 0.0010 \\u03bcg\\\/ml with a BMDL10 and BMDU10 of 0.0006 and 0.0016 \\u03bcg\\\/ml, respectively ().\\n\\nFigure 3.BMD covariate analysis of MN dose\\u2013response data for 4NQO in human lymphoblastoid cell lines AHH-1, MCL-5 and TK6 and the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y.

Exposure of TK6 cells with 4NQO for 4h followed by one cell cycle of cytochalasin B (18h) showed no significant increases in MN induction over the treatment range chosen (up to 0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml). However, high levels of cell death and cytostasis (60.1\\u201384.7%) was observed at 0.02 \\u00b5g\\\/ml of 4NQO and above (). Extended treatments of 24- and 48-h exposure to 4NQO followed by one cell cycle of cytochalasin B (18h) were subsequently performed. TK6 cells treated with 4NQO for 24h showed significant increases in MN frequencies only at 0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml. However, high toxicity levels were again observed at 0.02 \\u00b5g\\\/ml (55.5%) of 4NQO (). No significant increases in MN induction were observed when TK6 cells were exposed for 48h (+18h) to 4NQO; however, at 0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml, ~30% cell death and cytostasis were observed ().\\n\\nFigure 4.Effect of 4NQO on TK6 cells using the in vitro CBMN assay. TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO for 4, 24 or 48h, followed by 18h of cytochalasin B. Columns: percentage micronucleated binucleated cells, lines: RPD. Values represent mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (n = 3). **P < 0.01 (Dunnett\\u2019s post hoc test).\\n\\nIn a previous study (), it was shown that an extended recovery time might play a critical role in MN induction, at least in compounds with direct DNA reactivity, such as mitomycin C. Therefore, TK6 cells were further treated with 4NQO for 24h, followed by a 24-h (one and a half cell cycles) recovery period before harvesting. No significant increases in MN induction were observed however over a range of concentrations between 0 and 0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4NQO. About 40% (38.8%) cell death and cytostasis were observed at the top concentration (0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml) (). Further, a short-term treatment of 4h with an extended recovery period of over two cell cycles (40h) was also performed. Significant increases in MN induction were observed at 0.02 and 0.03 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4NQO. At the highest dose, 39.5% toxicity was reached (). Hence, recovery period appeared to be important for 4NQO-induced MN induction.\\n\\nFigure 5.Effect of 4NQO on TK6 cells using the in vitro MN assay. TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO for 24h, followed by a 24-h recovery period, or for 4h, followed by a 40-h recovery period. Columns: percentage micronucleated mononucleated cells, lines: RPD. Values represent mean and range of duplicate experiments. *P < 0.05 (Student\\u2019s paired t-test).\\n\\nSubsequently, the dose responses were further assessed by BMD modelling (; supplementary Figure 1, available at Mutagenesis Online). For the TK6 data after treatment with 4NQO for 4h followed by 18h of cytochalasin B, a BMD10 was calculated at 0.0044 \\u03bcg\\\/ml with BMDL10 at 0.0025 \\u03bcg\\\/ml and BMDU10 at 0.0092 \\u03bcg\\\/ml. TK6 cells treated with 4NQO for 24 and 18h of cytochalasin B revealed a BMD10 at 0.0029 \\u03bcg\\\/ml with BMDL10 at 0.0019 and BMDU10 at 0.0049 \\u03bcg\\\/ml, respectively, whereas TK6 cells treated with 4NQO for 48 and 18h of cytochalasin B revealed a BMD10 at 0.0103 \\u03bcg\\\/ml, BMDL10 at 0.0053 \\u03bcg\\\/ml and BMDU10 at 0.0597 \\u03bcg\\\/ml. For the TK6 cells with an extended recovery time of 24h after 24-h 4NQO treatment, a BMD10 was calculated at 0.0057 \\u03bcg\\\/ml with a BMDL10 and BMDU10 at 0.0034 and 0.0107 \\u03bcg\\\/ml, respectively. TK6 cells with an extended recovery time of 40h after 4-h 4NQO treatment revealed a BMD10 at 0.0047 \\u03bcg\\\/ml with a BMDL10 and BMDU10 at 0.0026 and 0.0108 \\u03bcg\\\/ml, respectively (). The BMD covariate approach ranked and grouped 4NQO by potency in the different culture conditions. It was shown that 4NQO in TK6 cells were very closely grouped (, supplementary Figure 1, available at Mutagenesis Online).\\n\\nTo summarise, 4NQO showed little to no significant increases in MN induction in the human lymphoblastoid cell lines TK6, AHH-1 and MCL-5, even up to 55\\u00b15% toxicity. However, a dose\\u2013response relationship was observed in the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y after 4NQO treatment, even at concentrations with no reduction in cell viability, indicating an important role of the tumour suppressor gene TP53.\\n\\nHPRT gene mutation and DNA damage induction in TK6 cellsDue to the widespread use of 4NQO as a positive control in genotoxicity testing and the lack of convincing positive results in many of the above MN studies, we employed the HPRT and comet assays to investigate the induction of gene mutations and DNA damage by 4NQO.\\n\\nFor the HPRT assay, TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO for 24h up to 0.02 \\u00b5g\\\/ml. Significant increases in gene mutation were observed at 0.01 and 0.02 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4NQO (). These are lower concentrations than any of the MN-inducing doses in the above experiments (0.02 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4 + 40h). Hence, 4NQO might be a much more effective point mutagen than clastogen.\\n\\nFigure 6.HPRT gene mutation frequency (number of 6TG resistant clones\\\/106 clone-forming cells) in TK6 cells treated with 24h of 4NQO. Values represent mean \\u00b1 standard deviation (n = 3). *P < 0.05 (Dunnett\\u2019s post hoc test).\\n\\nWith the comet assay, low levels of DNA damage can be detected. The assay was performed with and without hOGG1. hOGG1 is an endonuclease that recognises oxidative DNA damage (). TK6 cells were treated with 4NQO for 3h showed significant increases in DNA damage at 0.04 and 0.06 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4NQO, without hOGG1 and at 0.06 \\u00b5g\\\/ml 4NQO with hOGG1 (). In summary, 4NQO induced gene mutation and DNA damage at the higher range of concentrations tested.\\n\\nFigure 7.The in vitro comet assay.

Values represent mean and range of duplicate experiments. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01 (Student\\u2019s paired t-test).\\n\\nDiscussionThis study investigated the DNA damage induction by 4NQO at a low concentration range. 4NQO\\u2019s carcinogenic action is believed to be initiated by the enzymatic reduction of its nitro group (,). The reduction product 4HAQO of 4NQO reacts with DNA to form stable monoadducts with purine bases, which are considered to be responsible for its mutagenicity and genotoxicity ().\\n\\nThe metabolically competent cell lines MCL-5 and AHH-1 were treated with 4NQO for 4h. 4NQO showed little to no significant increases in MN induction in AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells, even up to 55\\u00b15% toxicity. Further, in comparison to TK6 cells, AHH-1 and MCL-5 cells could be treated with a 10\\u00d7 higher concentration of 4NQO without reaching the 55\\u00b15% toxicity threshold suggesting their more robust nature. MCL-5 is a derivative of the AHH-1 cell line. Both cell lines are heterozygous for a p53 mutation at the interface between the codons 281 and 282 of exon 8 (). The L5178Y cell line is known for its dysfunctional p53 activity, since they have a missense mutation in exon 5 on chromosome 11a (amino acid changes from a cysteine to an arginine) and a nonsense mutation in exon 4 on chromosome 11b (changing a glutamine to a stop codon) (,). L5178Y cells showed highly significant increases in MN induction and no decreases in cell viability could be observed at all (,). The tumour suppressor gene TP53 plays an important role in cellular integrity, with an integral function in transducing signals from damaged DNA to genes that control the cell cycle and lead to apoptosis. Consequently, the effects of DNA damaging agents could become significant at low concentrations, where p53 competent cell lines would induce DNA damage\\u2013dependent cell death or cell cycle blockage ().\\n\\nIn addition to the p53 status of a cell, the participation of DNA repair pathways and differences in DNA repair capacity may influence the genotoxic responses in different cell lines. To our knowledge, there are no published data on variations in the repair abilities of the cell lines used in this study. However, previously conducted studies in our research facility showed minimal differences between mRNA levels of several alkylating agent relevant base excision repair enzymes in MCL-5, AHH-1 and TK6 cells (data not shown). Further experiments into the endogenous DNA repair protein levels and activity in the different cell lines need to be conducted to investigate the influence of variations in DNA repair on genotoxicity studies between cell lines. In addition, the differences in metabolic proficiencies of the various cell lines did not seem to have an impact on the observed dose responses, as 4NQO showed no increased genotoxicity in the cells with known metabolic competence. The chromosomal damage studies in p53 competent TK6 cells revealed that the short-term treatments (4h) without prolonged recovery time and extended treatments (24 and 48h) showed little to no chromosomal damage induction up to 55\\u00b15% cytotoxicity. However, extending the recovery time up to two cell cycles in the mononucleated assay increased the magnitude of MN induction at the higher concentration range. A study from Sobol et al. () showed that an extended recovery time after treatment with compounds with direct DNA reactivity in TK6 cells increased the magnitude of MN induction. Further it was proposed by Islaih et al. () that TK6 cells have prolonged cell cycle delay in response to genotoxins. Therefore, it might be possible that damaged cells are stalled rather than eliminated through apoptosis (). Consequently, the extended recovery period would allow the stalled cells to progress into mitosis and hence to fix damage as a MN. In support of this, it was further noted in the present study that toxicity appeared to be higher in cells with the shorter recovery time than in cells with the extended recovery time. BMD modelling with covariate analysis provided further evidence for clear PoDs in most of the cell lines tested (no dose\\u2013response curve was observed in MCL-5 cells). The model estimated concentrations that produced predetermined biologically relevant increases in response over the control. The lower limit on the BMD10 is termed BMDL10 and is often considered an adequate PoD (). The BMD covariate analysis () also allowed for ranking of 4NQO treatments in different cell lines to derive information on their genotoxic potency and showed that treatment of 4NQO in AHH-1 cells was the least potent, whereas the treatment in L5178Y was the most potent. Non-linear dose\\u2013response relationships for genotoxins have substantial implications for the setting of safe exposure levels and the understanding of cancer risk (,).\\n\\nIn conclusion, TK6 cells showed a smaller magnitude of MN induction and more cytotoxicity than the p53 mutated human lymphoblastoid cell lines AHH-1 and MCL-5 and in particular the mouse lymphoma cell line L5178Y, after 4NQO treatment. The sensitivity to MN induction and cytotoxicity is dependent on the cell type. However, cell lines with a p53 mutation are more likely to survive and replicate with DNA damage, which can lead to higher MN frequencies, since p53 plays an important role in cell responses, such as cell cycle arrest at the G1\\\/S or G2\\\/M phases, induced apoptosis and enhanced DNA repair in response to DNA damage (). Cytoprotective mechanisms and DNA repair capacity after treatment with low concentrations with the genotoxin seem to play an important role in the observed dose responses.\\n\\nIn this study, it was shown that 4NQO was a weak inducer of chromosomal damage in human lymphoblastoid cells. Therefore, further investigations into the induction of gene mutations by 4NQO were undertaken. Increases in point mutations over the solvent control were observed in the HPRT assay, even at concentrations lower than those showing MN induction. Mutagenesis caused by 4NQO has been shown to be specific for base-paired substitutions, predominantly as G to A transitions, but also G to T conversions and rare substitutions of adenines (). 4NQO induces three main adducts: dGuo-N2-AQO, dGuo-C8-AQO and dAdo-N6-AQO, with relative proportions in double-stranded DNA to be ~50, 30 and 10%, respectively (). Further, it was shown that 4NQO induces apurinic\\\/apyrimdinic sites and single-strand breaks (). From this, it follows that further sequence analysis of 4NQO-induced mutations at the hprt locus in TK6 cells needs to be performed to determine the mutation spectra induced. However, it is most likely that the mutations induced by 4NQO are base substitutions.\\n\\nThe comet assay was used for detecting low levels of primary DNA damage. Increases in DNA damage induction in the comet assay were observed. The assay can detect both single-strand breaks as initial damage as well those developed from alkali-labile sites under alkaline conditions (). As mentioned above, 4NQO causes apurinic\\\/apyrimdinic sites and single-strand breaks (). In previous studies, high levels of 8-OH-dG were found in 4NQO-treated cells, which implicated the involvement of ROS in the mutagenicity of 4NQO (,,). Therefore, the lysed cells in the comet assay were incubated with the lesion-specific endonuclease hOGG1 to detect any oxidative DNA damage. Initial look at hOGG1 revealed little differences and the concentration levels investigated were in the cytotoxic range. Consequently, further experiments have to be undertaken to investigate the role of ROS in the mutagenicity of 4NQO.\\n\\nIn conclusion, this study was designed to assess the shape of the dose\\u2013response curve at low concentrations of 4NQO in human cells in vitro and to investigate the effect of different cell lines and study design on genotoxic potency and PoD metrics. The HPRT assay showed a PoD for DNA damage at a lower concentration than that of the MN assay and the comet assay, while the MN assay provided lower PoD metrics than the comet assay. From this it follows that it is most likely that 4NQO predominantly induces gene mutations, more so than DNA strand breaks or chromosomal damage. The difference between effects in the comet and MN assays could be due to variations in the type of DNA alterations that the test detects, while the comet assay detects primarily DNA lesions that are repairable, the MN assay detects irreparable lesions (). From this it follows that the suitability of 4NQO as a positive control for genotoxicity testing has to be evaluated for every individual assay.\\n\\nSupplementary data\\nSupplementary Figure 1 is available at Mutagenesis Online.\\n\\nFundingThis study was supported by a Collaborative Award in Science and Engineering (CASE) studentship from Medical Research Council (MRC, grant number: G0900840-1\\\/1) and AstraZeneca.\\n\\n\\n\\nSupplementary Material\\n\\n\\nSupplementary Data\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"HPRT1\",\"GeneForms\":\"gene\",\"Organism\":\"Homo sapiens\",\"Interaction\":\"4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide results in increased mutagenesis of HPRT1 gene\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^mutagenesis\"}]"}]}

The main elements that WAT employs in this regulative role are: a) its large capability to store energy as triacylglycerols, depleting circulating levels [], a function that extends in part to the removal of excess glucose [] used for lipogenesis []; b) its ability to reverse the storage process, releasing fatty acids to the bloodstream through lipolysis []; c) the modulation of other (and self) tissues through the secretion of hormones and paracrine agents []; and d) the wasting of energy, a postulated role [] traditionally attributed to brown adipose tissue, and insufficiently characterized in WAT.\\n\\nOleoyl-estrone (OE) is a signalling molecule from WAT that has been postulated as a ponderostat modifying agent [], since its administration induces a severe wasting of the body fat reserves [], reducing WAT lipogenesis and substrate uptake rather than elicit increases in lipolysis, increasing fatty acid output []. This process is in part mediated, at least in liver, by SREBP1c [], under conditions in which glycolysis is not completely blocked irrespective of a large availability of fatty acids []. Notwithstanding, basically the OE mechanism of action remains largely unknown.\\n\\nThe combined administration of a specific \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist with OE results in an assumedly synergistic effect of both agents inducing a massive WAT wasting, but nevertheless maintaining the circulating levels of the main metabolic indicators within the normalcy range []. OE reduces WAT mass at the expense of a decrease in energy intake with maintained thermogenesis [,], whilst most \\u03b23-adrenergic agonists elicit a massive lipolysis to fuel an increased thermogenesis, but barely affect food intake [], and tend to show limited effects because of downregulation of the receptors [].\\n\\nThe discovery of \\u03b23-adrenergic receptors in brown and white adipose tissue [] generated an enormous research effort to obtain agonists for these receptors that could elicit an increase in thermogenesis without the dangerous secondary effects of unspecific \\u03b2-adrenergic stimulation [,]. A large number of compounds were obtained [] but none was finally commercialized because of the short-time span of their efficacy and the rapid down-regulation of the receptors []. There is a number of \\u03b23-adrenergic agonists available that show very little superposition in their effects with \\u03b21 or \\u03b22 receptors. We had previously used CL316,243 [] in a previous gross-energy study, in combination of OE, and found that this combination deeply affected the body energy reserves []. As a continuation, the purpose of this study is to check how WAT responds to the double challenge, determining whether there is a common sharing of pathways for WAT energy disposal, or their actions upon the tissue follow separate strategies. Finally, we also wanted to know whether there is (or not) a synergistic effect favoring the depletion of body fat when using the combined slimming agents approach.\\n\\nMethodsAnimals and experimental setupMale Wistar rats (Harlan-Interfauna, Sant Feliu de Codines, Spain) of 45 days were used. The rats were maintained under standard conditions (21-22\\u00b0C, 60-50 % relative humidity, and 12 h light\\\/dark cycle: on from 08.00) in three-rat cages, and were fed for five weeks a simplified cafeteria diet []ad libitum. As previously described [], at the end of this phase the rats were already overweight; the animals were re-conditioned to eat standard pellet diet as sole food during an additional week (maintenance chow, Panlab, Barcelona, Spain).\\n\\nFour groups of six animals, initially weighing 360-380 g, were randomly selected: a) Controls; b) oleoyl-estrone: OE; c) \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist (B3A) CL316,243: B3A; and d) oleoyl-estrone and \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist: OE+B3A. Groups B3A and OE+B3A were implanted on day 0 subcutaneously in the back with an osmotic Alzet minupump (type 2002, Alzet, Palo Alto CA, USA) under isoflurane anaesthesia; the minipumps were loaded with B3A, the \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist CL316,243 [](Sigma, St Louis, MO USA) dissolved in saline. The minipumps released B3A at a rate of 0.5 \\u03bcl\\\/h in the subcutaneous space, at a dose of 1 mg\\\/kg and day. The rats in the OE and OE+B3A groups received a gavage containing OE (OED, Barcelona, Spain) in 0.2 ml sunflower oil, at a daily dose of 10 \\u03bcmol\\\/kg. The gavage of rats in the control and B3A groups contained only oil. The rats were given the gavages at the beginning of the light cycle, and were maintained under standard housing conditions, with full access to water and food pellets; their weight and food consumption were recorded daily. The treatments continued for 10 days.\\n\\nAt the end of the experiment, the rats were killed by decapitation. The rats were dissected and samples of inguinal, retroperitoneal and epididymal WAT were rapidly taken, frozen in liquid N and weighed. Then, the three WAT pads (inguinal subcutaneous, retroperitoneal and epididymal) were completely dissected, blotted and weighed in order to obtain the total mass of each WAT site. Tissue samples were maintained at -80\\u00b0C until used\\n\\nThe experimental setup and procedures were approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Barcelona. All animal handling procedures were carried out following the guidelines established by the EU, and the Spanish and Catalan Governments.\\n\\nNucleic acid analyses, cellularityTissue samples were used for the estimation of total DNA, using a standard fluorimetric method with 3,5-diaminobenzoic acid (Sigma, St Louis MO USA) and bovine DNA (Sigma) as standard []. Tissue DNA content allowed the calculation of the number of cells per g of tissue and in the whole tissues sampled, based on the assumption that the DNA content per cell is constant in mammals; here we used the genomic DNA size data [] for somatic rat cells (5.6 pg\\\/cell). Mean cell mass was estimated from the number of cells and the tissue weight.\\n\\nTotal tissue RNA was extracted using the Tripure reagent (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis IN USA), and were quantified in a ND-100 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington DE USA).\\n\\nSemiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of gene expressionRNA samples were reverse transcribed using the MMLV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, W I USA) and oligo-dT primers. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) amplification was carried out using 0.010 mL amplification mixtures containing Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA USA), equivalent to 8 ng of reverse-transcribed RNA and 300 nM primers. Reactions were run on an ABI PRISM 7900 HT detection system (Applied Biosystems) using a fluorescent threshold manually set to OD 0.500 for all runs. W e analyzed the expression of the genes listed in the Additional File  Table S1, which includes the list of primers used.\\n\\nA semiquantitative approach for the ultimate estimation of the number of copies of each expressed gene mRNAs per tissue weight was used as previously described []. ARBP was used as charge control gene in all samples. All primers were selected and optimized to obtain values of r \\u2265 0.98, resulting in an efficiency range of 93-104 %.\\n\\ncAMP analysisFrozen tissue samples were homogenized in chilled perchloric acid 30 g\\\/L [] using a Polytron tissue disruptor (ultraturrax, Kinematica, Luzern, Switzerland); after neutralization with 2N NaOH, supernatants were used for a cAMP binding assay using a specific kit (TRK432, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK). Results for cAMP were expressed in amol\\\/cell; cAMP data, as well as specific gene mRNA content in the tissue were expressed as absolute data of content in the whole of the specific fat pad, as a way to specifically discriminate the global WAT site response to the stimuli regardless of cell size or number, parameters that may be also influenced by the treatments [,].\\n\\nStatistical analysisIn addition to the three sites studied, a fourth group of data was included, corresponding to the sum of the three sites. The data were obtained tabulating the experimental results for each animal. Statistical two-way ANOVA analyses was carried out using the Prism 5 program package (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA USA), with a limit of significance of P < 0.05. Spot comparisons between groups were done using the unpaired Student's t test.\\n\\nResultsBody weight, tissue cellularity and cAMP levelsFigure  shows the changes in body weight and food intake elicited by the 10-day pharmacologic treatment.

The statistical analysis of the differences in expression of the genes for these WAT sites is presented in Figure .\\n\\nFigure 2P values for the statistical significance of the effects of OE and B3A on the gene expression of lipid metabolism -related enzymes and factors in the main sites of WAT of male overweight rats treated with OE and a B3A (two-way ANOVA). Data in bold red italics represent significant decreases in the combined specific mRNA content in the given WAT site (and, in the case of \\\"combined WAT\\\" in the sum of all three sites) compared with controls receiving vehicle only. Data in bold green represent significant increases. Non-significant effects (NS) are in black. An asterisk * in the interaction (int) column denotes a significant (P < 0.05) interaction between OE and B3A effects.\\n\\nIn subcutaneous WAT, OE decreased the expression of \\u03b21 and \\u03b22-adrenoceptor genes, as well as PPAR-\\u03b1 and PPAR-\\u03b2\\\/\\u03b4. Insulin signaling was decreased: lower expressions of insulin receptor (but also its degrading enzyme), IRS-1, and GLUT-4 genes. A similar decrease in expression was observed for lipogenic agents SRBP1c, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes. Lipoprotein lipase, UCP3 and the cytokines leptin, resistin and visfatin expressions were also decreased. The effects of B3A were markedly different, since in this case all gene expressions studied were increased with respect to controls, with the (non statistically significant) exceptions of the \\u03b21-adrenal receptor, PPAR-\\u03b2\\\/\\u03b4, fatty acid synthase, adiponutrin, UCP1, UCP2, and the cytokines leptin and TNF\\u03b1.\\n\\nThe pattern of gene expression decreases elicited by OE was less marked in epididymal than in subcutaneous WAT, with only significant changes in PPAR\\u03b31, GLUT 4, lipoprotein lipase, adiponutrin, UCP3, leptin and resistin genes. However, the increases in gene expression induced by B3A were fully comparable to those of subcutaneous WAT, the only differences being: no significant effects on \\u03b2-adrenal receptors, IRS-1, UCP3 and adiponectin genes, but significant differences in fatty acid synthase and UCP1 gene expressions.\\n\\nIn retroperitoneal WAT, OE effects on gene expression were again different from the other two WAT sites. OE induced significant decreases in the gene expression of PPAR-\\u03b1, GLUT4 and a number of lipid-metabolism related genes: SREBP1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase and adiponutrin. OE also induced decreases in the expression of UCP2 and the adipokines TNF\\u03b1, leptin and resistin. The administration of B3A (alone or combined with OE) induced much less change in gene. expressions than in subcutaneous and retroperitoneal WAT. In this case B3A induced a decrease in the expression of the visfatin gene and increases in the \\u03b23-adrenergic receptor, phosphodiesterase 3B, PPAR-\\u03b1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, carnitine palmitoleoyl-transferase, fatty acid transporting protein 1, the UCPs, TNF\\u03b1, leptin and resistin.\\n\\nTissue gene expressions in combined WATWhen the data for gene specific transcripts present in the combined WAT sites were analyzed, the results became perhaps more clear: OE induced decreases in the expression of most genes studied, with the exceptions of \\u03b23-adrenergic receptor and phosphodiesterase 3B, PPAR\\u03b32, and IRS-1 as critical signaling and signal-transduction agents. There is a second group in which OE overall did not change significantly the expression of the WAT genes, all related with lipolysis and fatty acid import\\\/transport: hormone sensitive lipase, adipocyte TAG lipase, carnitine palmitoleoyl-transferase, and the fatty acid binding and transporting protein genes, as well as the markedly apoptotic-inducing adipokine TNF-\\u03b1 gene; these genes maintained mRNA strengths comparable with those of controls despite WAT size reduction, since they showed no significant differences in absolute terms. The effects of B3A were markedly uniform: all genes studied increased their expression versus controls with the sole exception of three: \\u03b21- and \\u03b22-adrenal receptors and leptin.\\n\\nDiscussionOE effects on the overall energy economy [,] are often more marked than in the actual changes in plasma metabolite [,] levels or the spectrum of gene expression changes [-]. This includes WAT, which in the end provides most of the energy wasted to maintain energy expenditure under a decreased energy intake also consequence of OE treatment []. In the present study we have confirmed the considerable differences that the main WAT sites present with respect to their response to OE [] or to other hormonal [] or pharmacological agents [].\\n\\nIt has been postulated that OE decreases WAT energy content by deregulating the equilibrium between lipogenesis (and triacylglycerol synthesis) and lipolysis [,]. In spite of marked differences between WAT sites, the cells of rats treated with OE were shrunk by the loss of fat; their decreased cAMP levels agreed with a generalized depression of lipogenesis. The lipolytic paths were not (or less-) affected, and fatty acid transport (both in, out of the cell, as well as into the mitochondria) was also decreased. It has been found previously (and the present result confirm -at least for WAT-) that OE does not induce marked changes in the expression of adrenergic receptor genes [].\\n\\nOE seems to induce a lethargic metabolic transformation of WAT, with generalized inhibition of metabolic activity, loss of fat and decrease in overall size [] diminished hormonal and cytokine [] signaling, and a more marked inhibition of the entry of energy substrates. Nevertheless, OE induces a marked loss of fat maintaining thermogenesis and the energy homeostasis exemplified by metabolite levels in plasma [].\\n\\nThe \\u03b23-adrenergic agonists were initially designed as brown adipose tissue stimulators -i.e. thermogenic agents- [] because of their abundance in this tissue. However, the presence of \\u03b23-adrenergic receptors in WAT [] independently of a wide site-related variation [], provides an additional foothold for their overall lipolytic and thermogenic effects; the increased cAMP levels found in WAT in B3A rats agree with their presence and functionality in the tissue. Curiously, B3A did not down-regulate the gene expression of the very receptors on which it acts, the \\u03b23 in contrast with the known problem of most \\u03b23-receptor agonists that rapidly lose effectiveness because of receptor downregulation []. In the present experiment, B3A has acted continuously (constant injection) for 10 days, inducing a severe wasting of WAT, but \\u03b23-adrenoceptors were downregulated by OE and not by B3A. This suggests that the generalized increase in gene expression induced by B3A is not only a consequence of its effects on its receptors, but possibly an effect also mediated through other hormonal or metabolic signal(s) affecting the whole animal but which effects were patently observed in WAT.\\n\\nWhen the data for cAMP were calculated as nmol\\\/g of tissue (a rough measure of its actual concentration in the tissue fluids) and correlated with the loss of weight experienced by the WAT site, irrespective of the treatment (i.e. controls, OE, B3A and their combination), we obtained a significant relationship between both parameters (r2 = 0.813; p < 0.0001). There were no differences between OE and B3A, which suggests that the loss of tissue weight (i.e. fat) was a closely direct correlate of the functional concentration of cAMP in the tissue. The increase in cAMP also elicited a marked increase in the expression of the phosphodiesterase gene (about twice than that of combined \\u03b2 receptors). Thus, fat mobilization was largely induced via cAMP cascade, and the mechanisms to control this increase were appropriately set in place both for OE and B3A.\\n\\nHowever, the almost universal increase in gene expression observed in rats treated with B3A suggests that probably its main effect is not the simple mobilization of fat, which proceeds at a pace comparable to that of OE -in fact carried out with much less fanfare- since there is a parallel stimulation of both lipolytic and lipogenic paths; glucose entry is probably enhanced (GLUT4, insulin receptor gene expressions) to fuel lipogenesis (SREBP1c, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase gene expressions), which combined with increased lipoprotein lipase and fatty acid transporters must provide a sizeable entry of substrates from the plasma. The problem is that lipolysis (hormone-sensitive lipase, adipocyte triacylglycerol lipase) and cAMP were also enhanced. All PPAR gene expressions, both lipogenic [] and lipolytic [] were also increased. Even contrary signals such as adiponectin and resistin were probably stimulated. The effectiveness of a contradictory stimulation of opposed pathways results in itself in a relative waste of energy, in a Penelope's Web way.\\n\\nThe limited overall effects of B3A on body size may in part reflect this disorganized process: adrenergic stimulation usually induces the loss of body weight through fat mobilization, but \\u03b22 agonists have been observed to increase body weight by modifying the accumulation of protein in muscle (e.g. clembuterol, []), an effect in part shared by other \\u03b23 agonists [].\\n\\nThe considerable increase in the expression of UCP1 gene due to B3A stimulation (56\\u00d7 alone or 68\\u00d7 combined with OE) (Figure ), yields an amount of UCP1 mRNA in the range of 15 % of that found in the interscapular brown adipose tissue mass of an adult male rat (unpublished data). This may represent that WAT plays a role in the marked increase of thermogenesis elicited by B3A, both in this same experimental model [] and others []. The \\\"browning\\\" of WAT was less affected by OE, which, in turn, decreased the gene expression of UCP2 and UCP3, which function seems more related with transport and regulation [] than pure thermogenesis, reserved to UCP1 []. The increase in UCP1 mRNA content represents an even higher concentration per unit of tissue weight\\\/per cell, since the WAT mass shrunk considerably compared with controls. In spite of OE not changing (or relatively decreasing) UCP1 gene expression in BAT [], its more limited effect on WAT (8\\u00d7 increase) could not be linked with adrenergic stimulation (low cAMP levels), and agrees with the marked differences in energy metabolism observed in brown adipose tissue [] compared with WAT []\\n\\nFigure 3Combined WAT (i.e. subcutaneous inguinal, epididymal and retroperitoneal) content of UCP1 gene mRNA in overweight rats treated with OE and\\\/or B3A for 10 days. The data are the mean \\u00b1 sem of six different animals. Statistical significance of the differences between groups: asterisk = p < 0.05 versus controls; black circle = p < 0.05 OE versus B3A and B3A+OE; no significant differences were found between B3A and B3A+OE.\\n\\nThere are reports linking the conversion of white to brown adipocytes as a consequence of continued catecholaminergic stimulation []; in the present study, however, subcutaneous WAT did not respond to these same stimuli as did the other WAT masses. The analysis of WAT metabolism and overall function as an organ [] or as a cluster of similar organs, is thoroughly complicated by their diversity in substrate processing, response to hormonal stimuli and their implication in the regulation of energy homeostasis []. A simple look at Figure  shows that subcutaneous WAT responds more easily to OE and B3A than the retroperitoneal, and the differences between epididymal and retroperitoneal (they are in part anatomically connected in the rat visceral cavity) are also considerable.\\n\\nIt is unclear whether the marked alterations in gene expression observed here translate into changes of their corresponding proteins, but at least they are a fair indicator of the processes that are activated, and the loss of fat (i.e. lower cell size and lower WAT site sizes) is a proven consequence that adequately fits with this explanation.\\n\\nIn sum, it is rather surprising that two different agents, with different mechanisms of action, that elicit widely opposed responses in WAT gene expression (OE stealthy but focused in the substrate imbalance; B3A loud and contrasting, resulting in handling-derived energy waste) end producing a very similar effect: shrinking of WAT, loss of fat, maintenance of cell numbers (i.e. practically no apoptosis). In addition, at the level of the whole animal, their effects are additive: OE decreases appetite, B3A increases thermogenesis, both waste WAT: the result is an accelerated loss of energy of up to 2.5 % of body energy per day in overweight rats [].\\n\\nConclusionsOE and B3A, elicit widely different responses in WAT gene expression on the three sites studied. Both drugs final effects were similar: shrinking of WAT size because of loss of fat but maintenance of cell numbers. OE acted essentially on the balance of lipolysis-lipogenesis and the blocking of the uptake of substrates; essentially hampering synthesis, and thus favoring lipolysis indirectly. B3A induced a shotgun increase in the expression of most regulatory systems in the adipocyte, an effect that in the end favored again the loss of lipid, probably due to the loss of metabolic coordination; this barely selective increase probably produces inefficiency. The waste of energy induced by B3A was compounded by the increase in UCP1 gene expression, since UCP1 provides thermogenic capability to adipocytes, thus increasing the energy waste by WAT itself as a contribution to the increase in overall thermogenesis induced by B3A.\\n\\nThus, OE in general lowered gene expression and stealthily induced a substrate imbalance. B3A increasing the expression of most genes enhanced energy waste through inefficiency rather than through specific pathway activation. There was not a synergistic effect between OE and B3A in WAT, but their combined action increased WAT energy waste.\\n\\nList of AbbreviationsWAT: white adipose tissue; UCP1: uncoupling protein 1; OE: oleoyl-estrone; B3A: CL316,243, a \\u03b23-adrenergic agonist.\\n\\nCompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\n\\nAuthors' contributionsRFL did most of the experimental work, obtaining and refining the results.

Exposure to estrogenic chemicals is a well-documented risk to human health based on the experience with prenatal exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) and its effects on development of the female reproductive tract (FRT). Many estrogenic compounds are found as environmental contaminants at levels sufficient to have adverse effects on human health. Phytoestrogens in the diet or nutritional supplements are common sources of environmental estrogen exposure (). The most abundant dietary phytoestrogens are the isoflavones genistein (Gen) and daidzein, which are present in soybean-derived products (). Even in strict vegetarians, adult serum isoflavone levels are low (\\u2264 0.5 \\u03bcM) and should have minimal estrogenic activity (; ).\\n\\nIn contrast to adults, infants fed soy-based formula have relatively high serum isoflavone concentrations; in a recent study,  found that the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles in serum were 1.5, 3.3, and 5.4 \\u03bcM, respectively, and the highest concentration was 13.2 \\u03bcM. In animal models these levels are clearly estrogenic, as indicated by uterine wet weight bioassays (). Two prospective studies demonstrate that soy-based infant formula elicits estrogenic responses in the developing human female (; ). Limited epidemiological information is available regarding long-term effects of infant exposure to soy-based formulas, but in a recent large study,  reported an increased incidence of physician-diagnosed fibroids by 35 years of age. These studies suggest that neonatal exposure to phytoestrogens or other environmental estrogenic chemicals could have a long-term effect on adult female reproductive health.\\n\\nFRT development is similar in most mammals, although the timing of morphogenesis differs among species. In the mouse, the FRT develops from the M\\u00fcllerian duct beginning on gestation day (GD) 13 (). Prenatal FRT development is controlled by several transcription factors and secreted signaling glycoproteins of the Wnt (wingless-related MMTV integration site) and hedgehog families. Anterior\\u2013posterior (AP) patterning of the M\\u00fcllerian duct is regulated by positional information derived from the Hoxa (homeobox A cluster) family of homeobox transcription factors. Expression of these genes becomes spatially restricted before birth, and distinct FRT regions eventually develop that correlate with increased expression of specific Hoxa genes: Hoxa9 in the oviduct, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 in the uterus and upper cervix, and Hoxa13 in the lower cervix and vagina (; ; ).\\n\\nEpithelial cell differentiation in the mouse FRT begins after birth and continues until adulthood. At birth, the oviduct is a simple tubular structure with a single layer of columnar epithelium. During the neonatal period, this epithelium differentiates into secretory or ciliated columnar cells in response to cues received from the underlying mesenchyme that vary along the AP axis (). These differences result in distinct patterns of epithelial morphogenesis such that the oviduct infundibulum and ampulla consist largely of ciliated epithelial cells, whereas the isthmus has more secretory cells. Similarly, uterine and vaginal mesenchymal cells generate cues that determine the epithelial cell types in those regions, with the adult uterus having mainly simple columnar cells and the vagina developing a stratified squamous epithelium ().\\n\\nThe neonatal FRT is highly sensitive to estrogenic disruption during morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. Numerous studies performed in animal models show that prenatal or neonatal exposure to estrogenic compounds causes dramatic alterations in FRT development and can lead to FRT cancers (). To determine whether exposure to environmentally relevant phytoestrogens has similar effects on FRT development and function, we used a mouse model of subcutaneous Gen exposure on postnatal days (PND) 1\\u20135 (50 mg\\\/kg\\\/day). As long as the final serum Gen concentration is similar, the effects of Gen derived from oral exposure during the neonatal period are comparable to those observed when Gen is administered subcutaneously (). This model generates serum Gen levels [maximum concentration (Cmax) in female pups, 6.8 \\u03bcM] similar to those found in human infants fed soy-based infant formula (; ). As adults, these mice have multioocyte follicles, lack regular estrous cycles, and are infertile even after superovulation, and approximately 30% develop uterine cancer (; ). Abnormalities in both the oviduct and uterus contribute to the infertility phenotype. Although the mice become pregnant, approximately 50% of the preimplantation embryos die in the oviduct after the two-cell stage, and the uterus does not support implantation (). The goal of the present study was to test the hypothesis that neonatal Gen treatment causes permanent changes in oviduct gene expression and morphology that could explain the oviduct\\u2019s contribution to infertility.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsAnimals and treatments. All animal procedures complied with National Institutes of Health\\\/National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences animal care guidelines; animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. Mice were fed NIH-31 mouse chow (Zeigler Brothers, Gardners, PA), which was assayed for phytoestrogen content as previously described (). Female CD-1 pups were injected subcutaneously on PND1\\u2013PND5 with corn oil (control) or Gen (50 mg\\\/kg\\\/day; Sigma, St. Louis, MO), ICI-182780 (ICI; 1 mg\\\/kg\\\/day; Sigma), or ICI (1 mg\\\/kg\\\/day) 30 min before Gen (50 mg\\\/kg\\\/day). Gen was prepared in a suspension of corn oil at 5 mg\\\/mL, and ICI was dissolved in corn oil at 1 mg\\\/mL. All treatments were delivered in 20 \\u03bcL corn oil, and doses were calculated based on a pup weight of 2.0 g. At 6\\u20138 weeks of age, the female mice underwent superovulation [equine chorionic gonadotropin followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), both at 5.0 IU in 0.1 mL saline; both from Calbiochem, Gibbstown, NJ] or superovulation and mating as described previously (). Only plug-positive mated females were used in experiments requiring pregnant mice.\\n\\nReal-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Samples were collected as follows (n = 3\\u20136 independent biological replicates per group). On PND1, oviducts, uteri, and cervix\\\/vagina from five mice were pooled per biological replicate. On PND5, oviducts, uteri, and cervix\\\/vagina were collected 4 hr after the last treatment; oviducts from three mice were pooled per biological replicate, but uterus and cervix\\\/vagina samples were from individual mice. For PND22 pups and adults, both oviducts from one mouse were pooled per biological replicate. For adult nonpregnant mice, oviducts of superovulated females were collected before (8 hr after hCG) and after (15 hr after hCG) ovulation, and cumulus masses were removed. For adult pregnant mice, oviducts of superovulated females were collected on GD2 or GD4 (48 hr or 96 hr after hCG, respectively), and embryos were removed. For untreated adult FRT samples, oviducts (pair), uterus, cervix, and vagina collected from one mouse per biological replicate.\\n\\nTotal RNA was isolated, and cDNA was generated from 1 \\u03bcg RNA using standard protocols. Primers were designed to amplify exon junctions. RT-PCR was performed on 20 ng cDNA using SYBR\\u00ae Green\\u2013based detection on an ABI 7200 HT sequence detector (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Relative gene expression was calculated by the \\u0394Ct method () using cyclophilin A (Ppia) expression for normalization.\\n\\nMicroarray analysis. Oviducts were collected on GD2 (48 hr after hCG), and embryos were removed. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gene expression analysis was conducted on four independent biological replicates for each group using Agilent Whole Mouse Genome 4 \\u00d7 44 multiplex format oligo arrays (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Slides were scanned with an Agilent Scanner, and data were obtained using Agilent Feature Extraction software (version 9.5), which performed error modeling, adjusting for additive and multiplicative noise. The resulting data were processed using Rosetta Resolver\\u00ae (version 7.2; Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) and deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no. GSE27639; NCBI, Bethesda, MD).\\n\\nHistology and immunohistochemistry. Formalin-fixed tissues were paraffin embedded and sectioned at 5 \\u03bcm. Sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) or Masson\\u2019s trichrome according to standard protocols. For Pitx1 (paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 1) immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in Tris-buffered saline\\\/Tween 20 (TBST). Rabbit polyclonal anti-Pitx1 antibody () was diluted 1:150 in TBST containing 1% BSA and 1% milk. Biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG (1:500; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), ExtrAvidin (1:50; Sigma), and NovaRED (Vector) were used for detection. For E-cadherin immunohistochemistry, sections were blocked with 10% horse serum and avidin\\\/biotin blocking reagent (Vector), and E-cadherin antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:150 dilution. The secondary antibody was from the Vectastain Elite Kit (Vector), and diaminobenzidine was used for visualization.\\n\\nImmunoblotting. Total oviduct protein (5 \\u03bcg\\\/mouse in each lane) was separated on Novex 4\\u201312% Tris-glycine gels and transferred to polyvinyl difluoride (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Blots were blocked with 5% milk in TBST and then incubated with either Six1 [sine oculis-related homeobox 1 homolog (Drosophila); 1:1,000; Abcam, Cambridge, UK] or \\u03b2-actin (0.2 \\u03bcg\\\/mL; Sigma) primary antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase\\u2013conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ). Bands were visualized using West Femto Reagents (Pierce, Rockford, IL).\\n\\nStatistical analysis. We analyzed data using JMP software (version 9; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Student\\u2019s t-tests were used to compare control and Gen-treated samples at each time point.\\n\\nResultsAbnormal oviduct histology after neonatal Gen treatment. As a first step in determining why preimplantation embryos from neonatal Gen-treated mice had poor survival in the oviduct after the two-cell stage, we analyzed the histology of oviducts collected on GD2. Oviducts from Gen-treated mice retained the expected regional differences between the infundibulum, ampulla, and isthmus (); however, significant abnormalities were present in tissue and cellular morphology compared with controls. The stromal and muscle compartments were abnormally thickened in all oviduct regions, reminiscent of uterine myometrium and stroma (). The thickened areas mainly consisted of additional muscle tissue, and many areas did not have the normal clearly defined outer and inner smooth muscle layers (). In some areas of the ampulla, pseudoglands were near the outer epithelial surface of the oviduct, with no intervening muscle layers (). There were localized areas of excessive epithelial proliferation, and many regions had areas of epithelial disorganization that were particularly apparent after cell borders were labeled by immunostaining for E-cadherin (). This staining also revealed that the epithelial cells had enlarged, rounded nuclei and were cuboidal rather than the predominant tall columnar epithelial cells observed in controls.\\n\\nFigure 1Oviduct histology on GD2 in controls (A,E,I,C,G,K) and after Gen treatment (B,F,J,D,H,L).

Bars = 100 \\u03bcm.\\n\\nAlterations in oviduct gene expression during neonatal Gen treatment. We hypothesized that the changes in oviduct morphology were a result of Gen-induced alterations in expression of genes that influence postnatal FRT morphogenesis. The effect of Gen treatment on oviduct expression of secreted signaling proteins and transcription factors previously documented to affect FRT development was examined by real-time PCR at the completion of Gen treatment on PND5 (). Wnt genes required for FRT development include Wnt4, Wnt5a, and Wnt7a (). There was no difference in Wnt4 expression, whereas Wnt5a was up-regulated and Wnt7a was almost completely repressed in Gen-treated mice compared with controls. Follistatin-like-1 (Fstl1), a diffusible oviduct mesenchymal factor, which promotes formation of ciliated epithelial cells (), was significantly reduced in Gen-treated mice compared with controls. Secreted proteins in the hedgehog signaling pathway can regulate postnatal FRT morphogenesis and adult FRT function, and Wnt genes can be targets of hedgehog signaling (). Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and hedgehog interacting protein (Hhip) were highly up-regulated, and desert hedgehog (Dhh) was up-regulated 2-fold, after Gen treatment compared with controls, whereas sonic hedgehog (Shh) was not detected (data not shown). GLI-Kruppel family member 1 (Gli1), a common downstream mediator of hedgehog signaling, was also up-regulated, indicating that Gen treatment caused activation of hedgehog signaling in the neonatal oviduct.\\n\\nFigure 2Expression of genes important for FRT development on PND5 after Gen treatment. Data are mean \\u00b1 SE relative oviduct mRNA expression plotted for indicated genes. *p < 0.05 compared with control.\\n\\nTranscription factors that regulate patterning and differentiation of the FRT include forkhead box a2 (Foxa2) and the posterior Hoxa genes (). Foxa2 expression was up-regulated on PND5 by Gen treatment. Expression of Hoxa9, Hoxa10, and Hoxa11 was decreased in oviducts of Gen-treated mice compared with controls, whereas Hoxa13 was highly up-regulated. This Hoxa gene expression pattern indicated that the PND5 oviduct was posteriorized; that is, the oviduct expressed Hoxa genes in a pattern similar to that normally observed in the posterior cervical and vaginal tissues ().\\n\\nAlterations in oviduct gene expression on GD2. We hypothesized that genes important for FRT morphogenesis and perturbed by neonatal Gen treatment would continue to be altered in adult oviducts and that additional oviduct genes would be misexpressed around the time of preimplantation embryo loss. Rather than choosing candidate genes, we performed a microarray-based gene expression analysis of oviducts from control and Gen-treated mice on GD2. We validated selected probes that covered a range of intensity values and fold changes by real-time RT-PCR [see Supplemental Material,  (http:\\\/\\\/dx.doi.org\\\/10.1289\\\/ehp.1104018)]. Principal component analysis showed sample separation into distinct groups based on treatment; this was confirmed using hierarchical cluster analysis (see Supplemental Material, ).\\n\\nTable 1Most highly up- and down-regulated oviduct genes.\\n\\nGeneGene nameFold change (gene\\\/control)Up-regulated genesPitx1paired-like homeodomain transcription factor 199.3Serpina3aserine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 3A10.3Hao3hydroxyacid oxidase (glycolate oxidase) 38.4Lipflipase, gastric7.6Osapovary-specific acidic protein7.5Igkv5-43immunoglobulin kappa chain variable 5-437.4Prss35protease, serine, 357.1Cxcl15chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 156.9Six1sine oculis-related homeobox 1 homolog (Drosophila)6.8Serpina5serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 56.8Cyp11a1cytochrome P450, family 11, subfamily a, polypeptide 16.7Nkx3-1 NK-3 transcription factor, locus 1 (Drosophila)5.9Down-regulated genesKcne1potassium voltage-gated channel, Isk-related subfamily, member 1\\u20134.9Serpina11serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 11\\u20134.9Myh7myosin, heavy polypeptide 7, cardiac muscle, beta\\u20135.1Myh6myosin, heavy polypeptide 6, cardiac muscle, alpha\\u20135.2CochCochlin, coagulation factor C homolog coagulation factor C homolog (Limulus polyphemus) \\u20135.3Serpina1dserine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1D\\u20135.7Olaholeoyl-ACP hydrolase\\u20135.9Spock1sparc\\\/osteonectin, cwcv and kazal-like domains proteoglycan 1\\u20136.0Serpina1eserine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1E\\u20136.2Serpina1bserine (or cysteine) preptidase inhibitor, clade A, member 1B\\u20136.2Epha6Eph receptor A6 \\u20137.8Ano2anoctamin 2\\u201318.4Of the > 41,000 probes on the array, 1,125 probes were significantly altered (analysis of variance, p < 0.01) in Gen-treated mice compared with controls. Duplicate probes and probes with average intensity < 100 in both treatment groups were removed from the analysis data set. Within the remaining probes, 335 genes were up- or down-regulated \\u2265 2-fold; the most highly altered genes are shown in . Significantly altered Ingenuity biological function categories included development, immune response, and cell proliferation [see Supplemental Material, Table 2 (http:\\\/\\\/dx.doi.org\\\/10.1289\\\/ehp.1104018)]. Four of the six secreted signaling proteins (Wnt7a, Ihh, Dhh, and Hhip) and one transcription factor (Foxa2) that were altered on PND5 after Gen treatment by PCR analysis were also significantly altered on GD2 by microarray analysis. Taken together, these findings indicate that neonatal Gen treatment permanently altered gene expression in the adult oviduct.\\n\\nThree of the most highly up-regulated genes on GD2 were the homeobox transcription factors Pitx1, Nkx3-1 [NK-3 transcription factor, locus 1 (Drosophila)], and Six1. These genes all have critical roles in embryonic development but are not reported to be expressed in FRT tissues. We hypothesized that misexpression of these early development transcription factors contributed to abnormal oviduct morphogenesis in Gen-treated mice. To test this idea and to further verify the microarray data, we performed real-time RT-PCR on independently collected biological replicates. Oviducts were collected on PND5, on PND22 (prepubertal) from superovulated adult mice before and after ovulation, and on GD2 and GD4. Pitx1 and Nkx3-1 were highly up-regulated in Gen-treated mice compared with controls at all time points (). Pitx1 protein was not detected in control oviducts on PND5 (). However, Gen treatment induced Pitx1 expression in nuclei of sporadic oviduct epithelial cells in all areas of the PND5 oviduct (). As on PND5, Pitx1 was not observed in adult control oviducts (), but it was abundantly expressed in focal areas throughout the oviduct epithelium of adult Gen-treated mice (). Like Pitx1, Six1 mRNA was highly up-regulated at all time points, and Six1 protein was significantly increased in the oviducts of Gen-treated mice compared with controls ().\\n\\nFigure 3Expression of Pitx1, Nkx3-1, and Six1 in oviduct after neonatal Gen treatment.

Because oviduct Hoxa gene expression was posteriorized in Gen-treated mice, we tested the idea that aberrant expression of Pitx1, Six1, and Nkx3-1 was also related to FRT posteriorization. To do this, we first needed to determine the timing of Hoxa gene pattern establishment in controls. Hoxa gene patterning in PND1 controls resembled that in adult controls; that is, the highest levels of Hoxa9 were in the oviduct, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 in the uterus, and Hoxa13 in the cervix\\\/vagina (). These findings, together with alterations in the oviduct Hoxa pattern in Gen-treated mice on PND5 (), indicate that Gen exposure disrupted maintenance of previously established Hoxa gene patterning.\\n\\nFigure 4Expression of homeobox transcription factors in FRT tissues of control mice.

Abbreviations: cx, cervix; ov, oviduct; ut, uterus; v, vagina.\\n\\nTo determine if genes highly up-regulated in the PND5 oviduct by Gen treatment are normally expressed in the posterior FRT, we compared gene expression levels in the oviduct, uterus, cervix, and vagina of control mice. Pitx1, Six1, and Nkx3-1, like Hoxa13, were expressed exclusively in the cervix\\\/vagina and not in the uterus or oviduct on PND1 () and PND5 (data not shown). This expression pattern was still observed in control adults, when Pitx1, Six1, Nkx3-1, and Hoxa13 were highly expressed in the vagina and cervix but had minimal expression in the uterus or oviduct (). There was no Pitx1 protein in the adult uterus (). However, beginning in the cervix at the squamocolumnar junction, Pitx1 was detected in the nuclei of squamous epithelial cells (), and the staining intensity increased in vaginal epithelium (). Expression of the secreted signaling factors Wnt4, Wnt5a, Wnt7a, and Fstl1 was similar in all regions of the FRT on PND1 and PND5 and in adults (data not shown). In contrast, several hedgehog pathway genes and Foxa2 were more highly expressed on PND1 in the cervix\\\/vagina compared with both the oviduct (Ihh, 11.0-fold; Dhh, 5.8-fold; Hhip, 42.1-fold; and Foxa2, 6.1-fold increased) and uterus (Ihh, 9.4-fold; Dhh, 6.2-fold; Hhip, 63.1-fold; and Foxa2, 651.7-fold increased), suggesting that these genes are also normally restricted to the posterior FRT. Together, these data demonstrate that neonatal Gen treatment blocked the normal process of transcriptional silencing of many posterior developmental genes in the anterior FRT.\\n\\nTo determine if the effects of neonatal Gen treatment on the oviduct are mediated by its estrogenic actions (), we examined whether the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI () blocked these effects. Neonatal mice treated with both Gen and ICI did not have altered expression of Hoxa9 and Hoxa13, nor did they have altered expression of the three most highly up-regulated homeobox transcription factors (Pitx1, Six1, and Nkx3-1) observed in mice treated with Gen alone (). These findings indicate that molecular posteriorization of the oviduct in response to Gen treatment is mediated by its estrogenic action.\\n\\nFigure 5Inhibition of posteriorized gene expression (mean \\u00b1 SE) by ER antagonist in the oviduct on PND5. *p < 0.05 compared with control or Gen + ICI.\\n\\nDiscussionThe results presented here demonstrate that a brief neonatal exposure to the phytoestrogen Gen causes substantial permanent changes in oviduct morphology and gene expression in mice. The altered expression of Hoxa and Wnt genes in the oviduct combined with aberrant expression of homeobox transcription factors that are normally expressed only in the posterior FRT likely account for abnormal oviduct differentiation and subsequent abnormal tissue architecture and function later in life.\\n\\nCellular differentiation of the FRT occurs during postnatal development in rodents, ruminants, nonhuman primates, and humans (). Based on the presence of ER\\u03b1 in the FRT epithelium at birth, it is not surprising that an estrogenic compound administered during this period disrupts FRT morphogenesis and cellular differentiation. Indeed, numerous reports have described the effects of the potent synthetic estrogen DES on both prenatal and postnatal FRT development. Most of these studies have focused on the uterus; however, a few reports described the effects of DES on oviduct histopathology (). Furthermore, the doses of DES used had much higher estrogenic activity than that of estrogenic chemicals typically encountered in daily life. The neonatal Gen dosing strategy used in the present study results in a serum Gen concentration similar to that in human infants fed soy-based infant formula (). This model is also likely relevant to human exposure to low levels of other estrogenic environmental chemicals.\\n\\nPrenatal DES treatment alters the expression pattern of Wnt genes in the FRT on GD19 (). Similarly, in the present study, neonatal Gen treatment resulted in increased Wnt5a expression and significantly reduced Wnt7a expression in the oviduct on PND5, indicating that both prenatal and neonatal exposure to estrogenic compounds disrupts Wnt gene expression in the FRT. Stratified luminal epithelium is observed in the uterus of Wnt7a-null mice (), and in the present neonatal Gen model we found Wnt7a repression and a marked up-regulation in the oviduct of genes that are normally observed in stratified cervical\\\/vaginal squamous epithelium. These findings support the idea that Wnt7a is required for maintenance of the columnar epithelium in the oviduct and uterus and that Gen-induced Wnt7a repression in the neonatal FRT may promote oviduct posteriorization. However, if reduction in Wnt7a were sufficient to promote a cervical\\\/vaginal phenotype, we would expect that in control mice, Wnt7a expression would be lower in these tissues than in the uterus and oviduct. Instead, in controls during the neonatal period, Wnt7a is highly expressed in the cervix and vagina and is not differentially expressed compared with the uterus and oviduct. For this reason, the oviduct posteriorization in Gen-treated mice cannot be attributed to reduction in Wnt7a alone.\\n\\nHoxa genes direct AP patterning of the FRT and maintain a distinct spatial distribution in adults. From GD16.5 through GD19, Hoxa9 is similarly expressed throughout the FRT, but Hoxa10, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 are differentially expressed along the AP axis, with Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 highest in the uterus and Hoxa13 highest in the cervix and vagina (; ). On the day of birth (PND1), we found that Hoxa10, Hoxa11, and Hoxa13 had an expression pattern similar to that on E19, whereas Hoxa9 was more highly expressed in the oviduct compared with the uterus and cervix\\\/vagina. This Hoxa gene expression pattern is permanently maintained from the day of birth (PND1) forward because FRT tissues from PND14 and adult mice have a similar expression pattern (). Hoxa9 is not essential for FRT development because Hoxa9-null mice have normal fertility (). In contrast, Hoxa10- and Hoxa11-null mice have abnormal FRT development and function (; ). Hoxa13-null mice have agenesis of the caudal portion of the M\\u00fcllerian duct, and Hoxd13 (homeobox D13)-null mice that also lack one copy of Hoxa13 exhibit severe malformations of the vagina and external genitalia, suggesting critical roles for these Hox gene paralogs in posterior FRT development (; ).\\n\\nNeonatal Gen exposure alters Hoxa gene expression in the oviduct, with Hoxa9, Hoxa10, and Hoxa11 expression significantly reduced compared with controls and Hoxa13 increased. Similarly, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 are reduced in the uterus after neonatal DES exposure (; ; ). Because the adult pattern of Hoxa gene expression is normally present at birth, these data suggest that Hoxa gene patterning is not irreversible once established but retains some plasticity in the neonatal period. This finding is consistent with the observation that in Wnt7a-null mice, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 expression in the uterus is normal at birth but then gradually decreases (), suggesting that Wnt7a is required for maintenance of FRT Hoxa gene patterning.\\n\\nHoxa13 up-regulation may contribute to neonatal Gen-induced posteriorization of the oviduct by inducing expression of several genes normally restricted to the cervix and vagina. This finding is in agreement with a mouse knock-in study in which replacement of the Hoxa11 homeodomain with the Hoxa13 homeodomain (A1113hd\\\/13hd) resulted in posteriorization of the uterus to resemble a cervix\\\/vagina\\u2013like structure (). More than 30 genes normally expressed in the cervix and not in the uterus were expressed in the uterus of the A1113hd\\\/13hd mutants. One of these genes was the transcription factor Six1, suggesting that Six1 is normally regulated by Hoxa13 via a mechanism involving the homeodomain. In the present study, Six1 was highly up-regulated in the adult oviduct after neonatal Gen treatment, and we demonstrated that its up-regulation begins during the time of Gen treatment and remains stable through adulthood. This expression pattern correlates with the up-regulation of Hoxa13 in the oviduct, suggesting that Hoxa13 expression in the anterior FRT is a proximal factor in altering cellular differentiation and causing phenotypic and molecular posteriorization of the oviduct.\\n\\nOne explanation for the altered expression of Hoxa genes in the oviduct is that Gen-induced activation of ER-mediated transcription disrupts global regulation of Hoxa genes in the FRT. Indeed, Hoxa10 and Hoxa11 are regulated by estrogen in the adult FRT (). Regulation of Hox gene expression during mammalian development is complex and involves regulatory RNAs and proteins whose activities orchestrate the establishment and subsequent maintenance of the AP Hox expression patterns (for review, see ). Because Hoxa patterning in the FRT is already established at birth, alterations in initiation factors cannot explain Gen-induced disruption. Instead, alterations in maintenance factors, such as polycomb and trithorax group proteins, that preserve the initial Hox gene expression pattern and help cells \\u201cremember\\u201d which regulatory domains to keep silent and which ones to keep active, are more likely candidates.\\n\\nAlthough Hox genes may function upstream of Pitx1, Six1, and Nkx3-1 after Gen treatment, the converse may also be true. These three genes have critical roles in directing embryonic development of tissues outside the FRT. Six1 regulates development of numerous tissues, including the eye, skeletal muscle, and posterior limbs (; ). Nkx3-1 is important for prostate development and marks a stem cell population that functions during prostate regeneration (; ). Nkx3-1 was previously reported to be absent in the FRT, but tissues from the cervix or vagina were not examined (). Pitx1 is involved in development of anterior branchial arch structures and the hindlimb (; ; ). Pitx1 acts upstream of Hox genes during hindlimb specification because misexpression of Pitx1 in the chick wing bud leads to increased expression of Hoxc10 and Hoxc11 and results in transformation into a more leglike structure (). The permanent up-regulation of Pitx1, Six1, and Nkx3-1 in the oviduct of Gen-treated mice, combined with the importance of these genes in development of many embryonic tissues, suggests that one or all of these homeobox transcription factors may contribute to oviduct posteriorization after Gen treatment. Because Six1 causes initiation and metastasis of several types of human cancer (), its permanent up-regulation could contribute to the observed increase in FRT cancers in neonatal Gen-treated mice ().\\n\\nInfants fed soy-based formulas have high circulating levels of Gen (1.5\\u201313.2 \\u03bcM) (). The subcutaneous injection model of Gen exposure used in the present study produces serum circulating levels similar to those of human infants (Cmax = 6.8 \\u03bcM in female pups). Because the primary exposure of humans is oral exposure to the glycosylated form, genistin, we previously compared a dose response of oral exposure to genistin with that of subcutaneous exposure to Gen in neonatal mice (). Oral exposure to genistin in neonatal mice on PND1\\u2013PND5 produces similar circulating levels of Gen as a subcutaneous injection (~ 80%) and similar effects on the developing reproductive tract, including multioocyte follicles in the ovary, abnormal estrous cycles, and reduced fertility. All of these Gen effects are correlated with the circulating level of Gen and the estrogenic activity (uterine wet weight increase) during the time of treatment and are not dependent on the route of administration or form of Gen given. Therefore, the subcutaneous model used in the present study is a valid model for human infant exposures to Gen.\\n\\nConclusionsThe findings reported here raise the possibility that exposure to low levels of estrogenic environmental chemicals or phytoestrogens during sensitive developmental windows can alter developmental programming of FRT tissues. These changes could contribute to improper function of the FRT later in life that manifests as an infertility phenotype. Should this phenomenon occur in humans, it would provide the mechanistic basis for some cases of unexplained infertility, which is the sole infertility diagnosis in a significant percentage of couples who undergo assisted reproduction treatment by in vitro fertilization. In addition, the permanent up-regulation of developmental transcription factors in the FRT could have long-term effects on its structure and function, including influencing the development of benign or malignant pathologies.\\n\\nSupplemental Material(120 KB) PDFClick here for additional data file.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of

Most studies have used high doses of a single compound and short exposure periods, generally during the critical uterine or neonatal period. However, humans and wild animals are exposed simultaneously to various environmental and food EDCs, generally at low levels, throughout their lives. Therefore, it would be valuable to determine the effects of a chronic exposure to low doses of EDCs on the reproductive axis and to identify the mechanisms involved. In particular, it is not known whether lifetime exposures to low (environmental) doses of estrogenic \\u201cfeminizing\\u201d and antiandrogenic \\u201cdemasculinizing\\u201d EDCs can have adverse effects on male reproductive function of the same magnitude as those of acute exposure to high nonenvironmental doses of these compounds in isolation.\\n\\nIn this study, we used a rat model of prolonged exposure to EDCs by gavage to determine the effects on male reproduction of two EDCs that may be associated in the human diet: the phytoestrogen genistein and the antiandrogenic fungicide vinclozolin. Genistein is an estrogenic isoflavonoid found in leguminous plants (). It is particularly abundant in diets containing soya or soya-derived products, leading to a dietary exposure of up to 2 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day; for infants fed milk formulas containing soya, dietary exposure can reach 1 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day (). In previous studies involving transient gestational, lactational, or adult intakes (), rodents have been exposed to various doses of genistein but the findings are equivocal: some report male reproductive anomalies (), whereas other do not (; ). Human exposure to genistein may affect the responsiveness and sensitivity to other xenobiotics, particularly environmental estrogenic chemicals () and other endocrine-active dietary contaminants. Vinclozolin, a dicarboximide fungicide extensively used on fruit and vegetables, is recognized as a human diet contaminant acting\\u2014essentially through its two main metabolites M1 and M2\\u2014as an androgen-receptor (AR) binding antagonist (, ; ). A recent French study reported that 20% of 139 meal samples from work canteens contained measurable levels of vinclozolin (). In addition, assays of metabolites in urine revealed that > 80% of a population in central Italy was exposed to noticeable levels of vinclozolin and similar pesticides (). Vinclozolin administered to experimental animals in vivo at various doses, by various routes, and for exposure periods (gestation, lactation, puberty, adulthood) produces a wide spectrum of reproductive defects: reduced anogenital distance (AGD); persistent nipples; cleft phallus; hypospadias; cryptorchidism; reduced weights of the ventral prostate, seminal vesicles, and epididymis; and reduced sperm counts (; ; ). It is highly plausible that vinclozolin can induce such anomalies of the reproductive tract in humans (). However, most studies used doses 100 times the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 1.2 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day based on a combination of chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity in rats ().\\n\\nTo our knowledge, only one recent study has investigated the reproductive consequences (the frequency of hypospadias) of in utero exposure to both genistein and vinclozolin (). Using a lifelong exposure scheme, we found significant alterations of reproductive development and impairment of several fertility end points by these compounds, the most severe effect resulting from combined exposure to a dietary level of genistein and a level of vinclozolin lower than the U.S. EPA-proposed NOAEL. In addition, we found that mRNA expression profiles in the adult testis are notably and differentially modified according to the exposure protocol. We also describe functional clustering of the genes affected into ontologic families.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsChemicalsGenistein with a purity of 99% was synthesized at the Laboratoire de Chimie Organique et Organom\\u00e9tallique (Universit\\u00e9 Bordeaux 1, Talence, France). We extracted vinclozolin from the commercial formulation Ronilan (BASF France, Levallois-Perret, France) according to . The extract was dried under vacuum and then recrystallized from methanol. Vinclozolin has a melting point of 108\\u2013109\\u00b0C and its purity, as verified by HPLC-diode-array detection (from 192 to 400 nm) and gas chromatography\\\/mass spectrometry analyses, was > 96% (data not shown). In addition, we tested the absence of the degradation products M1 and M2 by liquid chromatography\\\/mass spectrometry as previously described ().\\n\\nDoses usedThe exposure scheme consisted of a \\u201chigh\\u201d and a \\u201clow\\u201d dose for each compound, and the corresponding combinations. The high doses we used were higher than the reported NOAEL of vinclozolin and the plausible levels of genistein in the human diet; we chose these doses to be sufficiently low to maintain normal growth, as well as food and water intake. The genistein high dose, 10 mg\\\/kg body weight (G10), was greater than the genistein levels found in human diets in Southeast Asia () and was several times lower than the doses used in some reproductive studies; the low dose, 1 mg\\\/kg body weight (G1), was similar to that in soya-based diets (). The vinclozolin high dose, 30 mg\\\/kg body weight (V30), was substantially greater than real-life exposure levels but was 3\\u201310 times lower than the doses used in several male reproductive studies (). The acceptable daily intake (ADI) of vinclozolin is 600 \\u03bcg\\\/day\\\/person, corresponding to an exposure of 0.01 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day (). In France, the estimated daily intake is 3.3 \\u03bcg\\\/kg\\\/person (), which is < 1% of the ADI. The low vinclozolin dose used in the present study, 1 mg\\\/kg body weight (V1), was higher than human food contamination levels; however, it was lower than the NOAEL combining chronic toxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive toxicity in rats (1.2 mg\\\/kg body weight\\\/day; ).\\n\\nAnimals and regimensA total of 80 specific-pathogen free (SPF) female and 32 SPF male Wistar Han rats at 8 weeks of age were purchased from Harlan France Sarl (Gannat, France) and fed with a soy-free diet (Harlan Teklad, Gannat, France). On their arrival, they were acclimatized to the animal facility conditions (22\\u00b0C with constant humidity and a 12-hr light\\\/dark period) for 4 weeks before mating. All animals were treated humanely and with regard for alleviation of suffering. They were maintained in accordance with the French Ministry of Agriculture guidelines for care and use of laboratory animals. From the acclimatization period, animals were fed a purified diet of pellets (18% casein, 46% starch, 23% sucrose, 5% corn oil, 2% cellulose, 5% mineral mixture, and 1% vitamin mixture) and supplied with water ad libitum. dissolved in corn oil (Carrefour, Dijon, France) and administered by gavage (2 mL\\\/kg body weight). Control animals were treated with the vehicle alone. Animals were identified by a unique ear tag with a randomly assigned number.\\n\\nExposure conditionsWe randomly assigned 10 females to each treatment group and mated them with male rats (five females and two males per cage) with the aim of obtaining at least 20 adult male offspring per treatment group for subsequent data comparisons and analyses. We examined females daily and caged them separately when a vaginal sperm plug was observed [defined as gestational day (GD) 1]. From GD1 until weaning [postnatal day (PND) 21], the dams were gavaged daily with the chemical preparations and then killed under anesthesia. On the day of parturition, all litter sizes were standardized to 10 offspring. From weaning (PND21) to adulthood (PND80), all animals were gavaged daily according to the various exposure protocols, and every 4 days they were weighed and inspected for anomalies.\\n\\nReproductive development end pointsOn PND25, we randomly selected five males from each group; the AGD was measured with a digital caliper, and the development of the penis was scored according to the procedure reported by . For both tests, the operator was blind to the treatment group.\\n\\nF1 mating and fertility end pointsOn PND80, six males per group were selected for mating with new unexposed acclimatized females (Harlan France Sarl); each male was housed with one female for 4 days. As described above, females were inspected daily; when a vaginal sperm plug was found, females were housed separately until parturition. We used the following fertility end points: mating index (number of mated females \\u00f7 number of females cohabited with males \\u00d7 100), fertility index (number of pregnant females \\u00f7 number of mated females \\u00d7 100), litter size, mean weight per neonate, sex ratio at birth, and percentage of postimplantation loss (number of embryonic scars \\u00f7 number of embryonic buttons and scars \\u00d7 100).\\n\\nSacrificeOn PND85, we anesthetized males using isoflurane (2.5%) and collected blood under heparin conditions from the dorsal aorta for subsequent hormonal tests. Animals were killed by thoracic cage opening. For each animal, both testes, epididymides and the seminal vesicles, ventral prostate, and liver were excised and trimmed of fat. We then weighed the tissues (Precisa model 125A; Precisa, Poissy, France) and calculated relative weights (weight of the organ in grams per kilogram body weight).\\n\\nSperm motility and motion characteristicsImmediately after epididymis separation, we excised approximately a 0.8-cm portion of the proximal part of the vas deferens and placed it in a Petri dish containing 4 mL of pre-warmed M199 medium (Gibco BRL, Paisley, Scotland) supplemented with 1% bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint-Quentin Fallavier, France). After incubating for 5 min at 37\\u00b0C, we swirled the Petri dish to facilitate the spontaneous release of sperm from the vas deferens. We loaded 10 \\u03bcL sperm suspension into an 80-\\u03bcm-deep, 2X-Cel disposable sperm analysis chamber (Hamilton-Thorne Research, Beverly, MA, USA). The device was placed on the heated stage (37\\u00b0C) of a computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) integrated visual optical system (Hamilton-Thorne Research). The acquisition parameters and rates used for analysis were those of standard rat analysis setup 1 (frame rate, 60 Hz; frames acquired, 30; minimum cell size, 7 pixels; minimum contrast, 15; brightness, 2,500). Sperm were considered motile if the average path velocity (VAP) exceeded 20 \\u03bcm\\\/sec and were considered progressively motile when VAP exceeded 50 \\u03bcm\\\/sec and straightness of trajectory (STR) exceeded 80%. We analyzed a minimum of 200 motile sperm from each animal for the following variables: percentage of motile sperm, percentage of progressively motile sperm, VAP (micrometers per second), straight-line velocity (VSL; micrometers per second), curvilinear velocity (VCL; micrometers per second), lateral head displacement (ALH; micrometers), beat cross frequency (BCF; Hz), STR (%), and linearity of trajectory (LIN; %).\\n\\nEpididymal sperm numberThe procedure used for assessing the sperm number in the cauda epididymis was based on specific staining of sperm DNA and counting with the CASA instrument (). We dissected out the cauda epididymis just below the point at which the vas deferens joins the epididymis at the distal corpus and at the boundary between the corpus and the proximal end of the cauda epididymis. The tissue was placed in a 50-mL plastic conical tube, chopped finely with scissors, and mixed with 25 mL physiological buffered saline plus 0.05 g\\\/100 mL Triton X-100. The preparation was then crushed with an Ultra Turax T25 basic homogenizer (24,000 rpm 3 \\u00d7 1 min; IKA, Staufen, Germany) The cauda epididymis preparation was stored frozen at \\u221220\\u00b0C. On the day of the sperm number assessment, we thawed the preparation, added 0.2-mL aliquots to vials containing the fluorescent DNA-specific dye bisbenzimide (Ident stain; Hamilton-Thorne Research, Danvers, MA, USA), and vortexed it for 30 sec. Following the manufacturer recommendations, we stained the sperm for 2 min. The preparation was vortexed again, immediately loaded into a standard-count disposable 20-\\u03bcm analysis chamber (Leja, Nieuw-Vennep, the Netherlands), and placed on the CASA stage. The sperm heads were clearly illuminated under an ultra violet beam, identified (and debris ignored), and automatically counted in 10 fields using the RAT-IDENT mode of the CASA instrument. The data are expressed as the total number of spermatozoa per cauda epididymal tissue sample.\\n\\nHistologyOne testis and one epididymis per animal were fixed in 4% formaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich), embedded in paraffin, cut into 4 \\u03bcm-thick sections, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (Sigma-Aldrich), and examined under light microscopy.\\n\\nAssays for plasma luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and estradiolOne plasma sample per animal was frozen at \\u221220\\u00b0C until assayed. LH and FSH reagents (AH R002 and AH R004, respectively, from Biocode-Hycel) were supplied by OSTEOmedical GmbH (B\\u00fcnde, Germany). The principle of the rat LH assay is based on competition between the LH of the rat sample and a 125I-labeled rat LH tracer for binding to a highly specific rabbit polyclonal antibody. The sensitivity of this assay is 0.14 ng\\\/mL. The rat FSH assay is a solid-phase immunoradiometric assay offering high affinity and specificity for two different epitopes on rat FSH. The sensitivity of the assay is 0.2 ng\\\/mL. We determined total testosterone and estradiol using the COAT-A-COUNT testosterone and estradiol radioimmunoassays (DPC France, La Garenne Colombes, France) according to the manufacturer\\u2019s protocols. The detection limits of the assays were 0.2 ng\\\/mL and 2 pg\\\/mL, respectively. All hormone concentrations were determined in duplicate.\\n\\nRNA preparation and microarraysWe prepared RNA from individual testes obtained from six animals in each group. RNA was quantified and the quality evaluated using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). The RNA integrity numbers for all RNAs were > 8. Pools of RNAs from six testes were prepared with strict equilibration of their quantity to ensure equal representation of each individual RNA. After quality control, we sent the samples to the micro array platform of NimbleGen (Reykjavik, Iceland). NimbleGen rat microarrays cover 23,456 transcripts represented by eight 60-mer oligonucleotides spotted in duplicate on the glass slide. The oligonucleotides are isothermic, which allows hybridization at a high temperature acceptable for the complete set of transcripts (70\\u00b0C). The correlation between the homologous oligonucleotides in each hybridization was > 0.99. We used Cluster 3 () and Treeview () for expression clustering, and DAVID software () for functional clustering.\\n\\nQuantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation and interindividual variationWe performed qRT-PCR for 10 genes using cDNA prepared from four individual testes [four animals in each category; PCR primers are described Supplemental Material,  (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1\\\/)]. The reactions were carried out in a 15-\\u03bcL volume using a Roche Lightcycler (Roche, Meylan, France) and an Invitrogen Sybergreen quantitative PCR kit (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France). After 2 min at 50\\u00b0C and 2 min at 94\\u00b0C, each reaction was carried out for 40 cycles (94\\u00b0C for 10 sec, 55\\u00b0C for 20 sec, and 72\\u00b0C for 20 sec when fluorescence was measured). This was followed by progressive melting by increasing the temperature from 60\\u00b0C to 99\\u00b0C over 10 min, with continuous fluorescence capture. We considered the resulting melting curve satisfactory if one peak only was visible on its derivative. In addition, PCR products were subjected to electrophoresis on an aga-rose gel to check for a single product of the expected size.\\n\\nData analysisStatistical tests were carried out using BMDP statistical software, version 2 for Windows (). We determined statistical significance of quantitative differences between treated groups and controls and between treatment modalities using post hoc Tukey\\u2019s pairwise comparisons after an analysis of variance. For visual clarity in the tables and figures, we present only the significant differences between each compound or mixture exposure modality and controls. Only pairwise significant differences in the various treatment modalities are reported in text. Differences for qualitative variables between treatment and control groups were tested using the Pearson chi-square test. The significance level is set at 0.05. However, for some aspects of the study (as indicated in tables and figures), we used a threshold of 0.10 because of the relatively small size of the groups. For several figures in both the article and the Supplemental Material (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1), we present box plots (rather than standard histograms showing only mean and SE values) in order to present the distributions observed for each exposure group and therefore the true level of variability.\\n\\nResultsDevelopmental anomalies and body and organ weightsThe observed anomalies of the external genitalia are summarized in . Penile development was immature in all groups except G1, V30, and G10 + V30. Overall, we found the highest rates of genitalia anomalies for the low-dose mixture, G1 + V1, and high-dose vinclozolin, V30. The body weights and relative organ weights in control and treated animals on PND80 are presented in . The gain in body weight was unaffected by any treatment (data not shown). The relative liver weight was significantly different from control only for G10 () and did not vary significantly among the different exposure groups studied. The relative epididymal weight was significantly lower in all treated groups compared with controls () and significantly lower in the low-dose mixture (G1 + V1) compared with V1 (p < 0.05). Relative testis weights were significantly higher in the high-dose mixture than in the low-dose mixture (p < 0.01). The relative prostate and seminal vesicle weights were decreased with V30 compared with controls. In these cases, the addition of genistein had no influence. For these organs, we found no significant difference between all the groups exposed to the compounds.\\n\\nSperm motility and kinematic characteristicsAll kinematic characteristics, except for the amplitude of ALH and LIN, were significantly altered in the treated animals. The VCL was significantly lower in all exposure groups than in controls, whereas the percentage of progressively motile sperm and the STR were significantly lower in all treated groups except G10 than in controls [; see also Supplemental Material,  (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1)].\\n\\nEpididymal sperm numberThe sperm reserve in the cauda epididymis was significantly lower than control values for G10, V30, G1 + V1, and G10 + V30, (), and it was significantly lower for the low-dose mixture than for G1 or V1 alone (both p < 0.005). We observed the smallest mean value for the low-dose mixture (58 \\u00b1 11 vs. 104 \\u00b1 14 \\u00d7 106 spermatozoa in the control; p = 0.02), which was not significantly different from that found for V30.\\n\\nHistologyTreatment had no obvious effect on testis and epididymis anatomy. However, we observed small variations in tissue\\\/organ histology [see Supplemental Material,  (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1)].\\n\\nHormone concentrationsOn PND80, mean FSH concentrations were significantly higher for G1 + V1, G10 + V30, and V30 than for control groups [13.0 \\u00b1 5.1, 11.6 \\u00b1 2.0, and 12.3 \\u00b1 4.3 vs. 9.9 \\u00b1 2.5 ng\\\/mL, respectively; all p < 0.05; see Supplemental Material,  (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158. S1)]. Mean estradiol concentrations were significantly lower than control values only in the G1 + V1 group (3.7 \\u00b1 3.9 vs. 6.1 \\u00b1 3.6 pg\\\/mL; p < 0.05; see Supplemental Material, ). Testosterone levels were significantly lower than controls in the G10 + V30 and G10 groups (2.0 \\u00b1 1.7 and 2.4 \\u00b1 2.6 vs. 4.0 \\u00b1 3.2 ng\\\/mL; both p < 0.05). The LH concentration tended to be higher than control values only in the V30 group (1.34 \\u00b1 0.81 vs. 0.97 \\u00b1 0.99; p = 0.07).\\n\\nMating and fertility summarizes the fertility of the exposed male rats crossed with non exposed females. The mating index was markedly but not significantly lower with the low-dose mixture compared with the control and the other exposure groups. Litter sizes were significantly smaller in the G1 + V1, G10 + V30, G1, and G10 groups; the smallest litters were in the low-dose mixture group (5.3 \\u00b1 1.5 vs. 13.0 \\u00b1 1.6 in controls; p < 0.05). Litter sizes did not differ significantly among the various exposure groups. The postimplantation loss was significantly higher in the V30 and the G10 + V30 groups than in the control group.\\n\\nTestis transcriptome analysisThe effects of the different treatments on gene repression\\\/induction were strikingly different. Applying a 2-fold threshold, genistein had a generally repressive effect on gene expression in the testis, particularly at the low dose; the high vinclozolin dose (but not the low dose) had the opposite effect (). The array results were validated by qRT-PCR with a sample of 10 genes [see Supplemental Material,  (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1)]; consistent with other results obtained with NimbleGen arrays (), the correlation between the array and the qRT-PCR was > 0.8. Using the complete data set, and no thresholds, the strongest correlation was between G1 + V1 and V30 [r = 0.82; see Supplemental  (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1); see also ]. This is in good accordance with the phenotypic observations: V30 and G1 + V1 had very similar effects on several markers. Nonsupervised hierarchical classification () showed perfectly correlated duplicates and illustrated the clustering of the genes modified by V30 and V1 + G1. This approach identified seven clusters of genes (). Functional classification of the genes enabled us to identify biological functions for each sub cluster (); we functionally analyzed each subgroup of genes using DAVID, after elimination of poorly annotated factors and olfactory receptor genes that are always highly represented in rodent microarrays. Among the genes significantly clustered in KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways, some were involved in regulation of insulin pathways (cluster 1); others were involved in fructose and glucose metabolism (cluster 2). Clusters 3 and 4 comprised genes involved in inter actions between ligands and receptors (e.g., dopamine, acetylcholine, histamine, parathyroid hormone, prostanoids), with the similar composition of the two clusters indicating a quantitative rather than a qualitative effect. The same applies to clusters 5 and 6, which were highly enriched in genes encoding ribosomal proteins. These genes were strongly down-regulated by all treatments except low doses of genistein. This may signify a slowing down of protein synthesis after exposure to the compounds. Finally, cluster 7 was functionally clustered but with relatively low statistical significances, and included mainly genes of the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pathway. We observed the major effect on these genes (up-regulation) in the G1 and G10 groups.\\n\\nDiscussionOur study provides evidence that lifelong exposure to low-dose genistein and\\\/or vinclozolin results in a number of anomalies of the male reproductive tract and fertility. This markedly contrasts with previous reports based on short windows of exposure to these compounds, whether gestational, neonatal, or during the puberty\\\/adult periods, showing only mild or no reproductive alterations [see Supplemental Material, Table 4 (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1)]. Interestingly, in the adult, despite the absence of macroscopic and microscopic modifications of the testis, we found various changes of the testis transcriptome for all exposure protocols. Furthermore, the intriguing similarities of the phenotypes\\\/genotypes of the animals exposed to high-dose vinclozolin and those exposed to the low-dose mixture, which probably depend on complex modes of action in this chronic exposure from conception to adulthood, may suggest an antiandrogenic action of genistein at a low dose when combined with low-dose vinclozolin (with a possible \\u201csynergistic\\u201d action because each compound taken alone at a low dose had no or a weak effect). By contrast and for several phenotypes (epididymis, seminal vesicle, and ventral prostate relative weights, as well as litter size), the effect of the high-dose mixture appeared milder than the effect of high-dose vinclozolin alone. This could suggest that, in these specific cases, a \\u201chigh\\u201d dose of genistein could attenuate the effects of vinclozolin. Finally, consistent with these observations, the effects observed for several end points were more pronounced with the low-dose mixture than with the high-dose mixture. Obviously our comments are purely speculative because of the descriptive design of the study, which warrants further work to approach the underlying molecular bases of these intriguing results.\\n\\nPhenotype modifications with F1 vinclozolin exposuresAt a vinclozolin dose of 30 mg\\\/kg body weight, we observed a rate of developmental anomalies of the reproductive tract that are consistent with the higher rate previously reported (); this validates our exposure protocol. At this dose, we also found some of the more detrimental effects on fertility, including a high rate of postimplantation loss (note that this end point was also high for the 1 mg\\\/kg vinclozolin dose). High-dose vinclozolin caused a significant increase in the FSH concentration, suggesting a direct effect on the pituitary axis according to . The diminished fertility, evidenced by the reduced litter size, especially with the high dose, could be due, at least in part, to decreased sperm production and motility. It could also be partly the consequence of the marked effects of vinclozolin on sperm chromatin we reported previously (). Prenatal plus infantile exposure of male rabbits to 7.2 mg\\\/kg\\\/day vinclozolin increases the amount of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa, mostly due to nuclear and acrosomal defects (). These anomalies may result in impairment of the fertilizing ability, embryonic development, or both (; ). Whatever the period of exposure, most published studies involving low-dose vinclozolin report marginal or no effects [see Supplemental Material, Table 4 (doi: 10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1); ; ; ; ], contrary to the significant adverse reproductive effects observed at high doses (). Studies of rats exposed to vinclozolin have nevertheless revealed that dose\\u2013response relationships are not equivalent among end points (). AR expression in the male reproductive system of the rat varies according to time and cell type, such that the effects of vinclozolin may vary substantially according to developmental period(s) and duration of exposure. Indeed, some of the adverse effects observed in adults may depend on changes in AR expression related to the continuous exposure. In this respect, the phenotypic changes we observed with vinclozolin exposure were not necessarily induced only in utero or during the early neonatal period. In addition, they could have been mediated by as yet undescribed actions of vinclozolin, or its metabolites, independent of antagonistic action on ARs.\\n\\nPhenotype modifications with F1 genistein exposuresChronic exposure to dietary levels of genistein, from conception to adulthood, may have deleterious effects on male reproductive development, adult reproductive organs, and fertility. Some of our findings were in accordance with previous studies: the penis immaturity we observed on PND25 in the G10 group is similar to the delayed preputial separation after gestational and lactational exposure to 5 mg\\\/kg genistein in the diet in Long-Evans rats () and decreased plasma testosterone (for the \\u201chigh\\u201d dose only) reported by  for a similar dose. This result of  reinforces the idea that genistein decreases the steroidogenic response of Leydig cells, which express both estrogen receptor (ER) \\u03b1 and ER\\u03b2, although the expression of these ERs was not affected in our array experiments.  reported that dietary genistein down-regulates an early step of testosterone synthesis (expression of mitochondrial P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme, which catalyses the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone). However, as in the study of , the testosterone levels we found with G1 were not significantly abnormal, suggesting that the effect of genistein on Leydig cells may be dose dependent; consistent with this notion, at the doses and with the strain we used, no difference was detectable in our microarray experiment.\\n\\nSeveral of the adverse effects we observed are indisputably related to the estrogen agonist activity of genistein and the localization of both types of ERs that are expressed at various levels in male rat reproductive organs (; ; ). The lower reproductive performance observed here probably results in part from the combination of sperm movement anomalies for the low- and high-dose exposures and the reduced epididymal reserve (only for G10). Genistein decreases sperm motion variables in vitro by inhibiting the sperm protein kinase (), which our microarray experiments showed to be slightly decreased (reduced to 0.76 for G1). Moreover, genistein has been reported to inhibit \\u03b1-glucosidase, which is known to sustain sperm motility (); the expression of this enzyme was also slightly reduced by G1 in our experiment (\\u00d7 0.78). To our knowledge, the increased postimplantation loss we describe has not previously been reported. However, similar reproductive anomalies have recently been reported for CD-1 mice after neonatal exposure to genistein at environmentally relevant doses (), and the reported genotoxicity of genistein may be involved (). Genistein is a topoisomerase II inhibitor (), but we did not find any modification of the expression of the corresponding gene in the testis. Another important consequence of the lifelong genistein exposure was the high incidence of reproductive effects, and this contrasts strongly with the absence of effects reported for shorter gestational\\\/lactational, puberty\\\/adult exposures [see Supplemental Material, Table 4 (doi:10.1289\\\/ehp.0800158.S1)]. The possible potentiation of the effects of vinclozolin by exposure to low-dose genistein that we report here might be relevant for human risk assessment because of the similar exposure conditions.\\n\\nPhenotype effects of the F1 exposures to the mixtures: similarities of the effects with the low-dose mixture and high-dose vinclozolinIn our experimental conditions, the type and magnitude of effects of the low-dose mixture were close to those of high-dose vinclozolin alone. Low combined doses of genistein and vinclozolin significantly increased FSH levels and decreased estradiol levels, an effect very similar to that of high-dose vinclozolin alone. This result parallels the similarities between the effects of the low-dose mixture and the high-dose vinclozolin on sperm production, motility, and kinematics and on the weights of the epididymis and seminal vesicles. These various similarities evoke a synergistic androgenic effect with the low-dose mixture. Genistein has been reported to exhibit in vitro antiandrogenic activity in addition to its well-established estrogenic activity (). This type of mechanism may act in vivo and contribute to some of the anti androgenic demasculinizing effects observed here with the low-dose mixture, with a magnitude similar to that found for high-dose vinclozolin (the effects found with both exposure modalities, G1 + V1 and V30 were not significantly different for most of the end points studied). Consistent with this notion, combinations of antiandrogens at NOAEL doses have been induced significant synergistic effects in vivo (; ). However, more complex modes of actions cannot be ruled out because of our continuous exposure modalities and the multiple biological activities of both the compounds. The complex transcriptomic modifications caused in the adult testis illustrate this. Indeed, although the effect on gene induction of the high vinclozolin dose is generally stronger than that of the combination of genistein and vinclozolin, the overall effect is very similar. As a consequence, the phenotypic alterations may be very similar, even if the effects of the low-dose combination only seldom attain the 2\\u00d7 threshold.\\n\\nTestis transcriptome alterations and the phenotypes observedThe gene expression profile under the influence of the EDCs genistein and vinclozolin can be summarized as follows (). Genistein administered alone at a low dose had the smallest effects of all treatments tested. The alterations were minor, despite 1,089 genes being down-regulated (using a 2\\u00d7 threshold). This can be explained by the strong and exclusive deregulation of a particular cluster of genes (cluster 4), with most other clusters very similar to the controls. Cluster 4 is composed of genes involved in ligand\\\/receptor interactions, involving numerous hormone peptides and G-protein\\u2013coupled receptors. At a higher dose of genistein, with or without high-dose vinclozolin, the alterations were greater. Presumably, the effects of genistein mask the putative effects of vinclozolin, probably indicating that high doses of genistein are the driving force in the gene expression regulation.\\n\\nThe effects of vinclozolin at low and high doses were similar and were strongly correlated with the effects of the low-dose mixture. This suggests that the low genistein dose is able to potentiate the effects of vinclozolin. One possible mechanism is activation by genistein of specific receptors of protein ligands induced by low-dose vinclozolin, and specific preparation of the chromatin to bind specific transcription factors. One of the candidates for such an effect is the gene Cbx3 (Chromobox, 3 homolog), whose protein has a chromodomain able to regulate chromatin dynamics toward gene induction or repression ().\\n\\nConclusionA continuous exposure to low combined doses of genistein and vinclozolin affects male reproductive health by inducing reproductive developmental anomalies, alterations in sperm production and quality, and fertility disorders. The long-term deleterious consequences of chronic exposures to a low-dose mixture of genistein\\\/vinclozolin suggest complex modes of action; we are currently investigating this issue further. Transcriptome analysis may uncover specific factors with potentially major effects on numerous gene targets, such as Cbx3.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"vinclozolin\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"FSHB\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"vinclozolin results in decreased expression of FSHB protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Genistein\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"FSHB\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"Genistein results in decreased expression of FSHB protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Genistein\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"FSHB\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[vinclozolin co-treated with Genistein] results in decreased expression of FSHB protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"affects^cotreatment|decreases^expression\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"vinclozolin\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"FSHB\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"[vinclozolin co-treated with Genistein] results in decreased expression of FSHB protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"affects^cotreatment|decreases^expression\"}]"}]}

The pathobiological concepts of COPD\\\/emphysema take genetic and epigenetic risk factors into account and the modern concept of molecular disease mechanisms have recently been reviewed . A postulated lung structure maintenance program  provides a large enough conceptual framework for the integration of inherited and acquired mechanisms which can disturb the homeostatic balance which generally preserves the lung function even in individuals at an advanced age. A large body of experimental data characterizes the lung tissue destruction after varying periods of cigarette smoke exposure, however, few studies have addressed mechanisms of lung tissue destruction in non-smokers or animal models where emphysema occurs independent of smoke exposure , , and little is known about the role of dietary influences on lung structure maintenance.\\n\\nHere we investigate the impact of a copper-depleted diet and copper chelation on the integrity of the lung alveolar structures. Our studies have been inspired both by a human disease model, the X chromosome-linked, Menkes disease, which is characterized by an inherited copper transporter gene mutation and neonatal emphysema , and an animal model, the Blotchy mouse, which also develops emphysema. Underlying the mouse disorder are mutations in the Atp7a gene (the human homologue in Menkes disease is ATP7A), which encodes a copper-transporting ATPase , . Copper, an essential trace metal determines the activity of a number of critically important enzymes, among them: lysyl oxidase (LOX) and Cu-Zn SOD. Based on the many important functions of copper-dependent proteins we postulated that copper deficiency would lead to emphysematous lung tissue destruction, as previously reported in the rat and in the hamster , . Several mechanisms for the development of emphysema in copper deficient animals have been proposed, but not examined. Although impaired cross linking of matrix protein as a consequence of LOX inhibition provides a rather intuitive explanation for emphysema development in copper-deficient animals, the published data regarding LOX activity dependent emphysema are controversial. Kida et al. reported that administration of a LOX inhibitor caused emphysematous lesions in young rats , while Rubio et al. showed that LOX inhibition by itself did not cause emphysematous lesions in adult rats . Based on our investigations, we propose here a particular form of apoptosis, anoikis, as the mechanism of copper-deficiency emphysema. We show that copper-deficiency emphysema is associated with impaired expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1\\u03b1) target genes because of impaired HIF-1\\u03b1 transactivation, and we further show that copper deficiency causes a decreased expression and activity of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK).\\n\\nTaken together, the data derived from our animal model studies establish anoikis as a cause of emphysematous lung tissue destruction and also that proper function of FAK is required for the maintenance of the lung structure.\\n\\nResultsCopper depletion cause emphysema and lung cell apoptosisWe examined rat lung tissue sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin and found that copper depletion caused a significant emphysematous destruction of the lungs, which was uniformly present throughout the tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) treated rat lungs, and an increase of the mean alveolar airspace areas (MAAA) and mean linear intercept (MLI), compared to the control rat lungs (). By examining caspase-3 expression in the rat lung tissues, we found that the airspace enlargement was accompanied by caspase-3 expression (). Emphysematous lung tissue destruction is frequently attributed to activation of proteolysis and in particular to Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activation, yet our data do not support a role for MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the emphysema development in the copper depleted rat ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g001Figure 1Copper depletion by a copper chelator (tetrathiomolybdate:TTM) treatment causes emphysema and lung cell apoptosis.(A) Representative photomicrographs of HE-stained lung sections of control and TTM treated rats.

In addition, we found decreased expression of mRNA and protein levels of LOX, elastin, fibulin 1 (FBLN1) and fibrillin 1 (FBN1), whereas the expression of fibulin 5 (FBLN5) was increased (). Furthermore, we found decreased expression of integrin \\u03b26 mRNA expression in copper depleted rat lungs ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g003Figure 3Copper depletion decreases VEGF, lysyl oxidase (LOX), elastin, fibullin-1 (FBLN1), fibrillin-1 (FBN1) and integrin \\u03b26 expression in rat lungs.(A) The bar graphs show HIF-1a, VEGF, LOX, elastin, FBLN1, FBLN5 and FBN1 mRNA expression in TTM treated rat lungs measured by RT-PCR analysis, and quantified as a ratio of the expression in vehicle treated rats.

Whereas HIF-1\\u03b1 protein expression was decreased by copper depletion, the expression of the p300\\\/HAT (histone acetyl transferase) protein was increased by copper depletion (). To assess whether impaired HIF-1\\u03b1 binding to target genes could explain the reduced expression of VEGF and LOX in the lungs from copper depleted rats, the binding of HIF-1\\u03b1 extracted from the lung nuclear protein fraction to hypoxia responsive element (HRE) sequence expressing DNA was assessed. The results obtained using this binding assay indicate impaired lung tissue HIF-1\\u03b1 nuclear protein binding activity in the copper depleted lungs (). Because copper depletion caused in the lung tissue an increased expression of the HIF-1\\u03b1 coactivator p300, we addressed the possibility of impaired HIF-1\\u03b1\\\/p300 binding. Indeed, immunoprecipitation showed impaired HIF-1\\u03b1\\\/p300 binding (). Thus we present two separate- but likely linked- causes of impaired (by copper depletion) transactivation of HIF-1\\u03b1 target genes: decreased HIF-1\\u03b1 protein expression and impaired binding of the coactivating protein p300.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g004Figure 4Copper depletion affects lung tissue HIF-1a protein expression and its transactivational activity.(A) Representative Western blot analysis of HIF-1\\u03b1, histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), p300, factor inhibiting HIF (FIH) and Lamin A\\\/C in lung protein extracts from TTM treated rats.

Based on the combination of copper depletion-induced tissue gene and protein expression changes (decrease in the expression of VEGF and LOX), we considered that a separation of alveolar structure cells from their matrix may occur after copper depletion \\u2013 resulting in anoikis, loss of cell anchorage-dependent cell death. Therefore, we sought evidence in support of this hypothesis by examining the lung tissue for the expression of protein markers which characterize cells which die by anoikis , , . Taken together, the protein expression pattern shown in  supports the concept that copper depletion induces anoikis in lung alveolar cells, as reduced FAK phosphorylation, reduced AKT and ERK1\\\/2 phosphorylation, induced expression of caspase-8 and of p53 all have been described as markers of anoikis. In addition, we confirmed increased expression of Bim in lungs from copper depleted rats (). Importantly, double staining of Bcl-2 interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) and von Willebrand factor (vWF) shows that increased expression of Bim was found in the cells in and around the small arteries from copper depleted rat lungs ().\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g005Figure 5Copper depletion induces anoikis related proteins and inactivates focal adhesion kinase (FAK), AKT and ERK signaling in rat lungs.(A) Representative Western blot analysis of p53, caspase-3, caspase-8 and Lamin A\\\/C in lung protein extracts from TTM treated rats.

Indeed, we show that the compound 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride (1,2,4,5-BT), known as an inhibitor of auto-phosphorylation of FAK at Y397  and instillation of FAK siRNA caused emphysematous lung destruction ( and ). The phosphorylation of FAK was decreased both in the 1,2,4,5-BT treated and FAK silenced rat lungs compared with control rat lungs ( and ). We found increased expression of cleaved caspase-3 and caspase-8 both in the 1,2,4,5-BT treated and FAK silenced rat lungs compared with control rat lungs ( and ), and increased expression of Bim in and around the small pulmonary arteries ( and ). In the aggregate, these data support the hypothesis that inhibition of FAK-dependent cell signaling induces anoikis of alveolar septal cells in the lung.\\n\\n10.1371\\\/journal.pone.0030678.g006Figure 6Inhibition of FAK phosphorylation causes emphysema and increases anoikis related protein expressions in rat lungs.(A) Representative photomicrographs of HE-stained lung sections of control and 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride (BT) treated rats.

Here we present data which illustrate how copper deficiency can fundamentally derange transcriptional mechanisms which lead to decreased expression of genes encoding enzymes, growth factors and matrix proteins. Because these disregulations in their combination provide plausible explanations for copper-deficiency induced emphysema, the proteins and signal transduction steps involved in emphysemagenesis can perhaps also be identified as candidate components of the lung structure maintenance program , . Here we show for the first time that 1) copper deficiency induces anchorage-dependent cell death, a process important for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis  and metastatic cell dissemination in cancers , and 2) that the activity of the FAK is necessary to maintain a normal lung structure. The key findings resulting from our experiments are derived mainly from the analysis of lung tissue samples rather from in vitro studies of cultured cells. This allows the observation of the effects of copper depletion in the context of cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.\\n\\nWe found evidence for lung cell apoptosis in copper depleted rat lungs and also a lack of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation. Given the absence of inflammatory cell infiltration in the copper-depleted rat lungs, we next turned to the question whether copper depletion affected the expression of the important lung tissue structure maintenance factor VEGF . VEGF gene expression was reduced in the lung tissues from the copper depleted rats. One explanation for the reduced VEGF gene and protein expression was impaired transcription of this HIF-1a target gene , in particular because Martin et al. have shown that the prolylhydroxylase (PHD)-dependent HIF-1\\u03b1 protein stability was copper dependent . Because lung tissue HIF-1\\u03b1 protein abundance was only diminished to some degree, we investigated the effect of copper deficiency on lung tissue HIF-1\\u03b1 transactivation activity (binding to HRE). The binding of the nuclear HIF-1\\u03b1 to the HRE was significantly impaired although the expression of the transcriptional co-activator p300 was increased. We therefore immunoprecipitated HIF-1\\u03b1 and p300 protein and found a lack of p300\\\/HIF-1\\u03b1 binding. Feng et al. showed that copper depletion suppresses HIF-1\\u03b1 transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells by inhibition of HIF-1 binding to p300, probably through the inhibition of FIH activity . Our data demonstrating the lack or inhibition of p300\\\/HIF-1\\u03b1 binding (induced by copper depletion) appear to be sufficient to explain the impaired transcriptional activity of HIF-1\\u03b1 and also the reduced expression of LOX. We found that copper depletion also reduced lung tissue FBLN1 gene and protein expression, and such impairment may be associated with severely impaired lung development . Copper depletion also reduced the expression of FBN1. A mutation in the FBN1 gene has been reported in neonatal Marfan syndrome associated with emphysema . Furthermore, we found that elastin gene expression was also reduced in the copper depleted rat lung tissue. This finding complements a previous report based on the examination of fibroblasts from patients with Menkes syndrome .\\n\\nFAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that discretely localizes to membrane regions that attach to the extracellular matrix (ECM). FAK transmits signals from the ECM via integrins to the cytoskeleton and in particular to cytoplasmic proteins . Stimulation of integrins and FAK leads to a hypertrophic response in cardiomyocytes , and cell to ECM interactions perform critical functions in the control of cell proliferation and survival, . Our data showing a decreased expression of ECM and integrin in copper depleted rat lungs and the association decreased pFAK expression may explain the emphysematous tissue destruction as a consequence of lung cell apoptosis.\\n\\nThe lung tissue samples were also examined for the presence of a protein expression signature reported to occur in cells undergoing anoikis, which includes a reduction in FAK activity. FAK is a scaffold protein that sequesters proapoptotic proteins, such as p53 to mediate cell survival, and a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, which links signals initiated by the extracellular matrix and soluble signaling factors, and FAK is also involved in angiogenesis . For example, it has been shown that reduced expression of FAK reduces the expression of HIF-1\\u03b1 and VEGF in retinal pigment cells . Of importance, hydrogen peroxide caused a marked decrease in the levels of phospho-FAK in mesenchymal stem cells , and beta-aminopropionitrile induced inhibition of LOX activation, which is copper dependent, decreased activated FAK in breast cancer cells . Here, we show in the copper depleted lungs a reduction of phospho-FAK, together with increased expression of caspase-8 and both cytosolic and nuclear p53, a pattern consistent with anoikis . Taken together, the hypothesis of copper depletion-induced lung cell death via anoikis is also supported by the reduced tissue expression of phospho-AKT and phospho-ERK1\\\/2 and increased expression of Bim, which is known as an important mediator of anoikis .\\n\\nBecause FAK activity may command a central place in the lung structure maintenance program, we treated rats with an inhibitor of FAK phosphorylation and FAK siRNA, and found that FAK inhibition caused both anoikis and emphysema ( and ). It is known that FAK regulates cardiomyocyte survival  and that cardiac FAK knockout causes eccentric right ventricular hypertrophy . We now suggest that impaired FAK activation results in emphysema, since inhibition of FAK caused emphysema and generated a lung tissue expression pattern which is consistent with anoikis.\\n\\nWe found that inactivation of FAK is associated with the development of emphysematous lesions in rat lungs. Our data have been derived from histological, immunohistochemical and morphometric parameters, but are not independently supported by changes in lung function. Compliance measurement of the lungs could be performed in future studies to functionally describe the emphysematogenesis which is caused by copper deficiency.\\n\\nIn conclusion, we have attempted to elucidate molecular mechanisms of copper deficiency-induced emphysema and propose anoikis as a previously not described form of lung cell death. Copper deficiency-induced lung cell anoikis could be an epigenetic cause of emphysema formation in smokers and non smokers.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsEthics StatementThe protocol was approved by the animal care and use committee (IACUC) of the Virginia Commonwealth University.

Indianapolis, IN) and were injected intraperitoneally with 10mg\\\/kg body weight of TTM once a day for the first 2 weeks. Control rats received a normal diet (7012 Teklad LM-485 Mouse\\\/Rat Sterilizable Diet, Harlan Laboratories, Inc.) and were injected with PBS only. Other groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 weeks old) received 30 mg\\\/kg BW of the inhibitor of FAK phosphorylation, 1,2,4,5-benzenetetraamine tetrahydrochloride 5 days\\\/week, intraperitoneally. Control rats received PBS only. After 6 weeks, each rat was anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of thiobarbital sodium. The thoracic cavities were opened by midline incision, and a small sample of blood was obtained by cardiac puncture and placed in a heparinized tube for hematocrit determination. Right lungs were removed, and placed into RNAlater (Ambion) or frozen in liquid nitrogen. Left lungs were inflated with 0.5% low-melting agarose at a constant pressure of 25 cm H2O, fixed in 10% formalin for 48 hours and used for morphometry and immunohistochemical analysis.\\n\\nInvivo transfection of FAK siRNA in ratsFAK and negative control invivo siRNA were designed and synthesized by Invitrogen (Sunnyvale, CA).

The mixture of the siRNA and InvivofectamineTM (Invitrogen) reagent complexed with target siRNA were prepared according to the manufacture's protocol. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 weeks old) received the complex of Invivofecatmine\\u2122 and FAK or control siRNA at a dose of 1.5 ml\\\/kg BW, 2 days\\\/week by way of nasal instillation. Briefly, we restrained the rats following ketamine-induced anesthesia and placed the rat on its back on a warming pad, and carefully injected 1.5 ml\\\/kg of the invivofectamine-siRNA complex (1 mg\\\/ml siRNA) slowly into each nose.

Sections (3 \\u00b5m) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Images were acquired with a Carl Zeiss AxioCam color camera (Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH, Hallbergmoos, Germany) and analyzed using AxioVision\\u00ae Imaging System software (Carl Zeiss Vision GmbH). 10 lung fields per tissue section were captured at a 100 x magnification, then AxioVision\\u00ae Imaging System software was used to measure the MAAA and total length of alveolar perimeters (TLAP), the imaging system was also used to identify and quantify caspase-3 positive cells in lung sections (caspase-3 index), in pixels per \\u00b5m2. Emphysematous changes were also assessed by measurement of the MLI. MLI is a measurement of mean interalveolar septal wall distance, which is widely used to examine alveolar space size. The MLI was measured by dividing the length of a line drawn across the lung section by the total number of intercepts counted within this line, at x 100 magnification. A total of 40 lines per each rat lung were drawn and measured.\\n\\nImmunohistochemical staining of cleaved caspase-3 and dual staining of Bim and vWFFor staining of cleaved caspase-3, the slides with 3 \\u00b5m paraffin sections were deparaffinized in xylene, and rehydrated, and then submitted to microwave treatment in 10 mM citric acid monohydrate solution.

Following this secondary antibody application, sections were incubated with ABC complex (Vector, Burlingame, CA) for 30 min at room temperature, and developed with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vector, Burlingame, CA) until the desired stain intensity had developed. A light hematoxylin counterstain was applied. 10 lung fields per tissue section were captured at a 400 x magnification, and then the number of active caspase 3-positive cells was counted using the AxioVision\\u00ae Imaging System software using a color thresh-holding function. In each capture picture, the degree of caspase-3 positivity was indexed for the TLAP. Normal rabbit serum in the absence of primary antibody was used as a negative control.\\n\\nFor double immunofluorescence staining, lung sections (3 \\u00b5m) were deparaffinized and rehydrated.

Memory impairment was produced by scopolamine (0.5 mg\\\/kg, i.p.) in animals. Morris water maze (MWM) test was employed to assess learning and memory. Brain acetylcholinestrase enzyme (AChE) activity was measured to assess the central cholinergic activity. The levels of brain thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) were estimated to assess the degree of oxidative stress. Scopolamine administration induced significant impairment of learning and memory in rats, as indicated by a marked decrease in MWM performance. Scopolamine administration also produced a significant enhancement of brain AChE activity and brain oxidative stress (increase in TBARS and decrease in GSH) levels. Pretreatment of stevioside (250 mg\\\/kg dose orally) significantly reversed scopolamine-induced learning and memory deficits along with attenuation of scopolamine-induced rise in brain AChE activity and brain oxidative stress levels.

The dementing condition that has received the utmost attention in the past decade is Alzheimer\\u2019s disease (AD), which is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, accounting for 60\\u201370% of all cases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), 5% of men and 6% of women aged above 60 years suffer from dementia of AD worldwide.[] AD is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease characterized in the brain by the presence of senile plaques rich in insoluble aggregates of beta-amyloid and neurofibrillary tangles. Loss of cholinergic neurons in nucleus basalis magnocellularis of cortex is one of the most prominent features of AD, primarily accounting for memory loss.[] Clinical management of dementia is still a nightmare for the neurobiologist. Thus far, cholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, etc. are the mainstay of AD therapy. Antiinflammatory agents, antioxidants, nonsteroids and some neuroprotective agents have also been used, but with limited success.[] Most of the currently used therapeutic interventions provide only symptomatic relief and do not halt the progression of dementia; further associated side-effects also limit their use. Hence, there is a need for an agent that will not only provide relief but will also stop the progression of the dementia.\\n\\nStevioside, the major glycoside from the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana, has recently gained popularity because of its sweetening nature, being about 300-times sweeter than sucrose (0.4% solution).[] Various studies have revealed that in addition to its potential sweetening nature, it exert beneficial effects, including antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic, antihuman rotavirus, antioxidant, antiinflammatory and antitumor actions.[] However, its antiamnesic potential remains to be explored. Therefore, the present study has been undertaken to investigate the beneficial effect of stevioside in memory deficit of rats, employing scopolamine[] -induced amnesia as an animal model.\\n\\nMaterials and MethodsAnimalsWistar rats of either sex, weighing around 150\\u2013200 g, were employed in the present study. They were procured from the Veterinary University, Ludhiana. The rats were provided standard laboratory feed (Kisan Feeds Ltd., Chandigarh, India) and tap water. They wee exposed to an alternate light and dark cycle of 12 h and had free access to food and water. The animals were acclimatized to the laboratory conditions for at least 5 days before the behavioral test. The experimental protocol was approved by the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (IAEC) and care of the animals was taken as per guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA), ministry of Forest and Environment, Government of India.\\n\\nDrugs and ReagentsStevioside was purchased from Phyto-Organic, Ghaziabad, India. Folin-Ciacalteu\\u2019s phenol reagent was purchased from Merck Limited, Mumbai, India. 5,[] dithiobis (2-nitro benzoic acid) (DTNB), reduced glutathione (GSH), bovine serum albumin (BSA) and thiobarbituric acid were obtained from Loba Chem, Mumbai, India. Scopolamine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA. Scopolamine was dissolved in distilled water and administered intraperitoneally (i.p.).\\n\\nMorris-Water Maze Test (MWM)MWM test was employed to assess learning and memory of rats.[] The procedure described by Parle and Singh[] was used to assess the MWM performance of the animals. Escape latency time (ELT) in seconds was recorded and day 4 ELT was taken as an index of acquisition whereas day 5 time spent in target quadrant (TSTQ) served as an index of retrieval or memory.\\n\\nBiochemical ParametersCollection of tissue sampleThe animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the thoracic aorta and brain tissue were carefully removed. Thoracic aorta was used for endothelium-dependent and -independent relaxation, whereas brain tissue was subjected to various biochemical estimations. The removed brains were homogenized in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4, 10% w\\\/v) using a Teflon homogenizer. The clear supernatant, obtained after centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 min, was used to estimate acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, thiobarbituric acid-reactive species (TBARS) and GSH. Blood samples for biochemical estimation were collected just before sacrificing the rats.\\n\\nEstimation of brain AChE activityThe whole-brain AChE activity was measured by the method of Ellman et al. with slight modification.[] Change in absorbance per minute of the sample was read spectrophotometrically at 420 nm.\\n\\nEstimation of brain TBARS levelThe whole-brain TBARS level was measured by the method of Okhawa et al. with slight modifications.[] The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically (DU 640B spectrophotometer; Beckman Coulter Inc, Kraemer Boulevard, P.O. Box 8000, Brea., 250 S, Kraemer Boulevard, P.O. Box 8000, Brea, CA, 92822-8000, USA) at 532 nm.\\n\\nEstimation of brain GSH levelThe whole-brain GSH level was measured by the method of Beutler et al. with slight modifications.[] The absorbance was measured spectrophotometrically at 532 nm.\\n\\nExperimental ProtocolFour groups, each comprising of seven Wistar rats, were employed in the present study.\\n\\nGroup I (control group): Rats were administered normal saline 30 min before acquisition trials for four consecutive days and 30 min before retrieval trial (on day 5).\\n\\nGroup II (scopolamine-treated control group): Rats were administered scopolamine (0.5 mg\\\/kg, i.p.) 30 min before acquisition trial conducted from day 1 to day 4 and then vehicle (distilled water) only 30 min prior to retrieval trial conducted on day 5.\\n\\nGroup III (stevioside per se): Rats were administered stevioside (250 mg\\\/kg, orally) 30 min before acquisition trial conducted from day 1 to day 4 and then vehicle (distilled water) only 30 min prior to retrieval trial conducted on day 5.\\n\\nGroup IV (stevioside + scopolamine-treated group): Rats were treated with stevioside (250 mg\\\/kg, orally) 30 min before the administration of scopolamine. The remainder of the procedure was similar to that of Group II.\\n\\nStatistical AnalysisThe results are expressed as mean \\u00b1 standard error of means (S.E.M.). The data of behavioral results were statistically analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by post hoc Tukey\\u2019s multiple range test using Sigma Stat Statistical software version 3.5. A P-value <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.\\n\\nResultsVarious pharmacological interventions employed in the present study did not show any significant mortality. Further, no significant difference was observed between the results obtained from rats of either sex.\\n\\nEffect on ELT and TSTQ Using MWMControl animals showed a significant decrease in their day 4 ELT as compared to its value noted on day 1 [], reflecting acquisition (learning). Further, these mice significantly spent more time in the target quadrant (Q4) in search of missing platform as compared to the time spent in other quadrants (Q1, Q2, Q3) during retrieval trial conducted on day 5, indicating memory or retrieval [].\\n\\nTable 1ELT effect of stevioside on scopolamine-induced changes in ELT using MWM\\n\\nGroupDoseDay 1 ELTDay 4 ELT(seconds)(seconds)Control10 mL\\\/kg (p.o.)89.2 \\u00b1 2.3449.6 \\u00b1 2.17Scopolamine treated0.5 mg\\\/kg (i.p.)83.8 \\u00b1 2.4592.6 \\u00b1 4.44Scopolamine + stevioside0.5 mg\\\/kg (i.p.) + 250 mg\\\/kg (orally)86.7 \\u00b1 2.4560.9 \\u00b1 2.45Stevioside250 mg\\\/kg (orally)90.2 \\u00b1 3.6252.5 \\u00b1 3.47Values are mean \\u00b1 S.E.M\\n\\na= P<0.05 vs. day 1 ELT in control rats\\n\\nb= P<0.05 vs. day 4 ELT in control rats\\n\\nc= P<0.05 vs. day 4 ELT in scopolamine-treated rats\\n\\nFigure 1Effect of stevioside on scopolamine-induced changes in time spent in target quadrant using Morris water maze.

Values are mean \\u00b1 standard error of means.\\n\\nDiscussionMWM test employed in the present study is one of the most widely accepted models to evaluate learning and memory of the animals.[] A significant decrease in day 4 ELT of control animals during the ongoing acquisition trials denoted normal acquisition of memory and an increase in TSTQ in search of missing platform during retrieval trial indicated retrieval of memory. These results are consistent with our earlier findings.[] In the present study, scopolamine produced impairment of acquisition and retrieval of memory, as reflected by significant increase in day 4 ELT and decrease in day 5 TSTQ, respectively. Acetylcholine (ACh) is a classic mediator of learning and memory. Drugs that reduce cholinergic function, such as muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine, cause profound memory impairments in animals and humans.[] The degeneration and dysfunction of cortical cholinergic neurons is closely associated with cognitive deficits of AD.[] These findings provide a cholinomimetic rationale for the treatment of dementia closely related to AD and support the use of animal models using muscarinic receptor antagonists.[] This contention is further supported by our study, whereby a significant impairment of learning and memory in rats treated with scopolamine has been observed. Moreover, scopolamine treatment also produced a significant enhancement of brain AChE activity and increase in oxidative stress, as indicated by a rise in brain TBARS and reduction in GSH levels, which is in line with previous findings.[]\\n\\nIn the present investigation, pretreatment of stevioside abolished scopolamine-induced memory deficits along with attenuation of scopolamine-associated increase in brain oxidative stress levels and brain AChE activity. Stevioside, being the main sweet component in the leaves of Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, has recently gained much attention as a sweetener.[] It has no caloric value and thus could be used to reduce sugar intake in diabetics, obese and patients of phenylketonuria.[] Stevioside, in addition to its sweetening property, has also been reported to exert many other effects, including antioxidative and antiinflammatory actions.[]\\n\\nStudies in the recent past have documented the important role of sweetening agent, i.e. glucose, in learning and memory, and there is extensive evidence in the literature indicating that modest increase in circulating glucose levels enhances the formation of new memories in rodents and humans.[] Glucose administration has been reported to enhance the memory processes by increasing hippocampal ACh synthesis and release.[] Furthermore, extracellular brain glucose levels have been demonstrated to vary with neuronal activity, suggesting that circulating glucose may be critical in modulating neural processes important for memory functioning.[]\\n\\nTherefore, from the above findings, it is evident that stevioside abolished scopolamine-induced memory deficits. This effect may be attributed to its sweetening property. However, its potential antioxidative and antiinflammatory actions also cannot be ignored because brain oxidative stress and inflammation play a critical role in the pathobiology of dementia. Moreover, the observed anticholinesterase action of stevioside in the present investigations might also have played an important part in its antiamnestic action.\\n\\nTherefore, it may be concluded that stevioside exerts its beneficial effect in scopolamine-induced memory deficits by virtue of its sweetening, antioxidative, antiinflammatory and anticholinesterase actions. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to explore the full potential of stevioside in memory deficits.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"Scopolamine\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"ACHE\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"stevioside inhibits the reaction [Scopolamine results in increased activity of ACHE protein]\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^reaction|increases^activity\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"Scopolamine\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"ACHE\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"Scopolamine results in increased activity of ACHE protein\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^activity\"},{\"ChemicalName\":\"stevioside\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"ACHE\",\"GeneForms\":\"protein\",\"Organism\":\"Rattus norvegicus\",\"Interaction\":\"stevioside inhibits the reaction [Scopolamine results in increased activity of ACHE protein]\",\"InteractionActions\":\"decreases^reaction|increases^activity\"}]"}]}

Beside the acute risk of unwanted detonation, there is a chronic risk of contamination, because the metal vessels corrode and the toxic and carcinogenic explosives (trinitrotoluene (TNT) and metabolites) leak into the environment. While the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity of TNT and its derivatives occurs through its capability of inducing oxidative stress in the target biota, we had the idea if TNT can induce the gene expression of carbonyl reductase in blue mussels. Carbonyl reductases are members of the short-chain dehydrogenase\\\/reductase (SDR) superfamily. They metabolize xenobiotics bearing carbonyl functions, but also endogenous signal molecules such as steroid hormones, prostaglandins, biogenic amines, as well as sugar and lipid peroxidation derived reactive carbonyls, the latter providing a defence mechanism against oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Here, we identified and cloned the gene coding for carbonyl reductase from the blue mussel Mytilus spp. by a bioinformatics approach. In both laboratory and field studies, we could show that TNT induces a strong and concentration-dependent induction of gene expression of carbonyl reductase in the blue mussel. Carbonyl reductase may thus serve as a biomarker for TNT exposure on a molecular level which is useful to detect TNT contaminations in the environment and to perform a risk assessment both for the ecosphere and the human seafood consumer.\",\"full-text\":\"IntroductionTrinitrotoluene (TNT) is one of the most used explosives worldwide, nowadays and in the past, both in civil and military activities (Juhasz and Naidu ; Beck et al. ). Since World War I, military munitions have been entered into the marine environment through two different ways: First, during war actions like fired but not exploded ammunition or munitions as a load on sunken vessels and shot down fighter aircrafts (Beck et al. ); second, by sea-dumping of munitions after World Wars I and II, since the involved nations were faced with a nearly uncountable number of ammunitions and other explosive materials produced by themselves or leftovers from the defeated nations (Beck et al. ). Today, as a consequence of these actions, we have to face several problems with regard to munitions in the seas. In addition to the risk of unwanted explosions, the most serious problem is that due to the corrosion of the munitions housings, toxic chemicals are being released and enter the marine environment. Porter et al. () detected TNT and other explosive chemicals not only in sediment and water but also in biota such as for example in different kinds of corals, dusky damselfish (Stegastes adustus) and sea urchin (Diadema antillarum) collected at the naval gunnery and bombing range of Isla de Vieques, Puerto Rico.\\n\\nTNT is toxic to all organisms. In humans, TNT and metabolites are mutagenic and of relevant urothelial carcinogenicity as well as toxic to the liver, kidneys, eyes, skin, blood system and spleen (Bolt et al. ). Many studies have shown acute and chronic toxic effects on marine species like shrimp, fish, copepods, corals, amphipods and bivalves (Nipper et al. ; Rosen and Lotufo ; Ek et al. ; Lotufo et al. ). Recently, Koske et al. () proofed the genotoxicity of TNT using zebrafish embryos (Danio rerio). Schuster et al. () demonstrated negative multilevel biological effects in the Baltic blue mussel (Mytilus spp.). Interestingly, the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity of TNT and its derivatives occurs through its capability of inducing oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the target biota (Bolt et al. ). In HepG2 and HepG3 cells, ROS formation by TNT causes DNA damage and induces apoptosis (Liao et al. ). Another study demonstrated that TNT induces oxidative stress in mouse, rat and human hepatoma cells (Naumenko et al. ).\\n\\nOxidative stress is able to perform peroxidation reactions of lipoproteins and lipids, thereby producing reactive carbonyl compounds which lead to modifications of DNA, lipids and proteins (Esterbauer et al. ). Detoxification by enzymatic carbonyl reduction of reactive carbonyl compounds to their corresponding alcohols, therefore, is a well-working defence mechanism. This reaction is catalysed by enzymes from two different protein superfamilies, referred to as aldo\\u2013keto reductases (AKR) (Penning ) and short-chain dehydrogenases\\\/reductases (SDR) (Persson et al. ).\\n\\nA subgroup of the SDRs, the carbonyl reductases, are of particular importance in the defence against oxidative stress and are particularly dealt with in this publication. Human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1; SDR21C1) was first characterized by Wermuth (). Later, human carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3; SDR21C2) was identified by Watanabe et al. (). While neurodegenerative disorders in humans like Parkinson\\u2019s, Alzheimer\\u2019s, Creutzfeld-Jakob and Huntington\\u2019s diseases are obviously aggravated by oxidative stress in the brain (Sayre et al. ; Dawson ), human CBR1 may contribute to neuroprotection due to its ability to metabolize reactive carbonyls derived from lipid peroxidation (Maser ). The role of CBR1 and CBR3 in the protection against ROS is underlined by their inducibility under conditions of oxidative stress (Ebert et al. ; Miura et al. ). In addition, toxic chemicals with impact on the environment like paraquat and even treated sewage are able to increase carbonyl reductase expression in Oncorhynchus mykiss and Zoarces viviparus (Albertsson et al. , ).\\n\\nIn previous investigations, TNT and its metabolites 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) were detected in blue mussels (Mytilus spp.) which had been exposed for several weeks in three active biomonitoring studies at Kolberger Heide (Strehse et al. ; Appel et al. ; Maser and Strehse ) (Fig.\\u00a0). Bivalves, as filter-feeding organisms are able to concentrate chemicals in their tissues, are robust and survive under moderate levels of different pollutants (Farrington et al. ). In many biomonitoring studies, mussels are, therefore, used as bioindicators for environmental pollution (Strehse and Maser ). On the other hand, with regard to marine pollution by TNT and its metabolites, specific biomarkers are urgently sought to detect TNT contaminations in the environment and to perform a risk assessment both for the ecosphere and the human seafood consumer.Fig. 1Location of the study site Kolberger Heide at the entrance to Kiel Fjord in northern Germany in the western Baltic Sea\\n\\n(source: www.google.de\\\/maps)\\n\\n\\n\\nBased on these facts that TNT exerts its toxicity through the development of oxidative stress and ROS, on the one side, and that the genes of carbonyl reductase are upregulated in their expression by ROS, on the other, we examined in the present approach whether the corresponding gene in the mussel is induced by TNT and whether carbonyl reductase is able to act as a specific biomarker in blue mussels for TNT detection. To answer this question, identification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp. as well as laboratory exposure studies towards TNT and field experiments were performed.\\n\\nMaterial and methodsIdentification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp.For identification and cloning of the Mytilus spp. carbonyl reductase gene and to obtain the optimum primer sequences for its amplification a BLAST search for carbonyl reductase genes on Mytilus genomic data and various genomes of model organisms was performed. From the resulting \\u201cproposed\\u201d gene sequence (Fig.\\u00a0) primers were designed (Table ) to obtain the coding sequence of the carbonyl reductase gene of Mytilus spp. used in the present study. Of note, the Mytilus species occurring in the western Baltic Sea are obviously a hybrid form of Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus edulis (Stuckas et al. ).Fig. 2Identification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp. M_CR_p \\u201cproposed\\u201d sequence of the carbonyl reductase gene, M_CR_s sequence of the carbonyl reductase gene after cloning and verification by Sanger sequencing, H_CBR1 sequence of human carbonyl reductase CBR1 from NCBI (GenBank accession number CR541708.1)\\n\\nTable 1Primers designed for RT-PCR\\n\\nPrimer nameGenBank accession noForward primer (5\\u2032\\u20133\\u2032)Reverse primer (5\\u2032\\u20133\\u2032)Amplicon size (bp)CRaATGGCAAAAAGAGTTGCAATTGTGTGGAAGCATTGCTAAATACACTGGTG76518\\u00a0s RNAL33448CAACCTGGTTGATCCTGCCAGTTATTGGAGCTGGAATTACCGCGG605aNo accession number for the \\u201cproposed\\u201d sequence of carbonyl reductase (CR) is given\\n\\n\\n\\nTo verify the bioinformatical outcome Sanger sequencing was performed. In brief: for amplification of the carbonyl reductase gene the coding sequence was cloned into a pJET 1.2\\\/blunt cloning vector. An amount of 1.5\\u00a0\\u00b5L cDNA was amplified with Phusion Hot Start II DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), 20\\u00a0pmol of primers as described in Table 1, and 200\\u00a0\\u00b5M dNTPs in a total of volume 20\\u00a0\\u00b5L. Thermo cycling was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 30\\u00a0s followed by 35 amplification cycles (98\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 10\\u00a0s, 50\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 30\\u00a0s, 72\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 30\\u00a0s) and a final extension step at 72\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 10\\u00a0min. The PCR product (765\\u00a0bp) was cloned into a pJET 1.2\\\/blunt cloning vector using the CloneJET PCR Cloning Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and NEB 5-alpha Competent E. coli (New England BioLabs Inc., Ipswich, MA, USA). The carbonyl reductase gene obtained from Mytilus spp. was verified by Sanger sequencing at the Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology, Kiel, Germany (Fig.\\u00a0).\\n\\nLaboratory exposure experimentsBlue mussels (Mytilus spp.) were purchased from a commercial mussel farm in Kiel Fjord. The mussels were transferred to the laboratory in an aerated cooling box with ambient seawater eight days before the experiments started. At the farm, water temperature and salinity were measured and recorded. Corresponding to the measured temperature, mussels were kept in a temperature-controlled lab using two 20-L aquaria filled with ambient seawater from the farm site. After 48\\u00a0h, ambient seawater was exchanged by half of the volume using premixed artificial seawater with an equal to ambient salinity of 18 psu. This procedure was repeated every 24\\u00a0h until the experiments started.\\n\\nThe artificial seawater was produced daily by mixing deionized water and Coral Pro Salt (Red Sea, D\\u00fcsseldorf, Germany), and pre-cooled before usage. The salinity was checked before water exchange using a conductivity meter. Every 48\\u00a0h, mussels were fed with 6\\u00a0ml live phytoplankton (Premium Reef Blend) per aquarium two hours prior to the water exchange. Twenty-four hours before the start of the exposure experiments, mussels were transferred to 15-L aquaria filled with 10 L of artificial seawater. During exposure, the room was kept constantly at 9\\u00a0\\u00b0C (96\\u00a0h exposure) and 3\\u00a0\\u00b0C (21\\u00a0days exposure), with a light\\\/dark rhythm of 8:16 according to the ambient conditions at the mussel farm.\\n\\nThree aquaria were used for each of the treatment concentrations and seven mussels were exposed per aquarium. The artificial seawater in the aquaria was spiked with different concentrations of a TNT solution, except for the three control aquaria. Water exchange and re-dosing of dissolved TNT was conducted on a daily basis by emptying and refilling the aquaria. To yield the required TNT concentration in the artificial seawater, a corresponding amount of TNT solution was transferred from the stock solution to the aquaria. The stock solution of 100\\u00a0mg\\\/L TNT was produced by the GEKA mbH (Munster, Germany) by dissolving TNT crumbs received from grenades from WW II in dichloromethane. Aliquots were removed from the solution, evaporated at room temperature and re-dissolved in water at 80\\u00a0\\u00b0C.\\n\\nThe following exposure experiments were performed: (1) an acute toxicity test (96\\u00a0h) with aquaria concentrations of 0; 0.31; 0.62; 1.25; 2.5,\\u00a05; 10\\u00a0mg\\\/L TNT solution following the guidelines of the OECD () and (2) a 21-day lasting chronic exposure experiment using 0; 0.31; 0.62; 1.25; 2.5\\u00a0mg\\\/L TNT solution (OECD ). After the experiments, the mussels were immediately kept dry and cool until dissection.\\n\\nField exposure experimentThe field exposure study was conducted at the munitions dumpsite Kolberger Heide in Kiel Bight at the entrance to Kiel Fjord, Germany (Fig.\\u00a0). In this area, several torpedo heads and mines had been destroyed selectively by blast-in-place operations in recent years (B\\u00f6ttcher et al. ). As a result, explosive materials have been distributed in the adjacent environment on the seafloor (Strehse et al. ). Two mussel bags with 15 mussels each (60.5\\u00a0mm\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20096.0\\u00a0mm length), were placed in January 2018 close to blast craters with explosive materials in the vicinity in a depth of approximately 11\\u00a0m. One of these bags was placed at the ground directly adjacent to a chunk of explosive material (7 U), the other at a height of 1\\u00a0m (7 O). The exposure period amounted to 58\\u00a0days and the sampling was done by Kiel University research divers. After recovery the mussels were immediately placed on dry ice and stored at\\u2009\\u2212\\u200980\\u00a0\\u00b0C until further use.\\n\\nTissue isolation, RNA extraction and cDNA synthesisMussels were opened and a maximum of 20\\u00a0mg tissue of each, gills, hepatopancreas, mantle and muscle, were transferred into 1.5\\u00a0mL Eppendorf tubes. Up to three samples of each tissue and mussel were taken. For stabilization of RNA, 200\\u00a0\\u00b5L of RNAlater\\u00ae reagent (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) were added to each tube and incubated overnight. Tissues were then removed from the reagent, transferred to 2\\u00a0mL Eppendorf tubes and stored until further processing at \\u2212\\u200980\\u00a0\\u00b0C. RNA was isolated using the commercially available Roti\\u00ae-Prep RNA MINI kit (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany). After addition of lysis buffer, the tissues were homogenized using a T25 Ultra-Turrax (Ika Works Inc., Staufen im Breisgau, Germany). RNA was purified according to the manufacturer\\u2019s protocol and quantified with Qubit\\u00ae HS RNA Assay kit (Carlsbad, CA, USA) on a Qubit\\u00ae 2.0 Fluorometer (Carlsbad, CA, USA). RNA was stored at \\u2212\\u200980\\u00a0\\u00b0C until further use. An amount of 1000\\u00a0ng of RNA was reverse transcribed using RevertAid H minus reverse transcriptase (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA, USA) with 400\\u00a0ng of Random Primers (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for 10\\u00a0min at 25\\u00a0\\u00b0C, followed by 60\\u00a0min at 42\\u00a0\\u00b0C and at \\u2212\\u200920\\u00a0\\u00b0C.\\n\\nGene expression experiments by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)PCR was performed with Phire Green Hot Start II DNA polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) using 1.5\\u00a0\\u00b5L cDNA, 20\\u00a0pmol primers and 200\\u00a0\\u00b5M dNTPs in a total volume of 20\\u00a0\\u00b5L. Thermo cycling was performed using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 30\\u00a0s followed by varying amplification cycles (six for the housekeeping gene and 22\\u201329 cycles for carbonyl reductase, respectively). The temperature program during the amplification cycles was performed at 98\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 5\\u00a0s, 50\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 5\\u00a0s, 72\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 15\\u00a0s. A final extension step was performed at 72\\u00a0\\u00b0C for 1\\u00a0min. M. edulis 18\\u00a0s RNA served as housekeeping gene (Cubero-Leon et al. ). An amount of 18 \\u00b5L of amplified PCR products was separated electrophoretically on 1% agarose gels and visualized by staining with GelRed\\u2122 (Biotest, Mannheim, Germany). Gels were documented digitally with Intas\\u00ae Gel-imaging system (Intas, G\\u00f6ttingen, Germany) and densitometrically analysed with GIMP 2.8 software.\\n\\nDetermination of explosive chemicals in mussel tissuesThe chemical tissue analysis was performed as described in Strehse et al. (): Mussel tissues were thawed, whole meat was placed in a 50\\u00a0mL polypropylene tube per mussel, and homogenized using a T25 Ultra-Turrax (Ika Works Inc., Staufen im Breisgau, Germany). Tissues were aliquoted into 1.0\\u00a0g portions in 50\\u00a0mL polypropylene tubes, and 5\\u00a0mL gradient grade acetonitrile (Th. Geyer GmbH & Co. kg, Renningen, Germany) were added per tube. Each sample was mixed for one minute using a VF2 vortex mixer (Ika Works Inc., Staufen im Breisgau, Germany). Tubes were centrifuged for 5\\u00a0min at 4 100\\u00a0rpm (20\\u00a0\\u00b0C) with a Heraeus Megafuge 11R centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Supernatants were decanted and filled with acetonitrile to a total volume of 10.0\\u00a0mL. GC\\\/MS-MS analysis was performed on a TSQ 8000 EVO Triple Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) with a Trace 1310 Gas Chromatograph (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) and using a TraceGOLD\\u2122 TG-5SilMS GC column (30\\u00a0m\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20090.25\\u00a0mm\\u2009\\u00d7\\u20090.25\\u00a0\\u00b5m).\\n\\nData analysis and statisticsValues of the measured concentrations of TNT and the metabolites 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT in the mussel tissues are expressed as mean\\u2009\\u00b1\\u2009standard deviation. Descriptive statistics of the densitometric results obtained from the RT-PCR experiments were computed with GraphPad Prism 8 (version 8.4.2).\\n\\nResultsIdentification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp.Since the Mytilus species occurring in the Baltic Sea are obviously a hybrid form of Mytilus trossulus and Mytilus edulis, we aimed, at first, on the identification and cloning of the carbonyl reductase gene of the Mytilus species used in the present study. By a bioinformatics approach, we obtained a \\u201cproposed\\u201d carbonyl reductase gene sequence (Fig.\\u00a0) which was used for primer design and cloning of the \\u201ctrue\\u201d coding sequence of the carbonyl reductase gene for our study (Fig.\\u00a0). The confirmed Mytilus spp. carbonyl reductase gene shares 89% identity to the \\u201cproposed\\u201d primary structure and 56% to human CBR1 (Fig.\\u00a0). Based on the latter fact, the Mytilus spp. carbonyl reductase can be regarded as a functional homolog to human CBR1, because, in addition, it shares all the essential SDR motifs (Persson et al. ).\\n\\nBasal expression of carbonyl reductase in Mytilus spp. tissuesAs a reference for the extent of gene induction through TNT, the basal expression of the carbonyl reductase gene was examined in different tissues of Mytilus spp. without TNT exposure (controls). Mussels were dissected to obtain the following tissues of interest: mantle, muscle, gills and hepatopancreas. While muscle tissue contained the lowest levels of carbonyl reductase expression, and intermediate levels were observed for mantle tissue and the hepatopancreas, the highest expression was observed in the gills (Fig.\\u00a0). This is an interesting finding and supports the fact that gills, as the first point of contact with oxygen-rich water, are particularly exposed to oxidative stress such that there is the need for high carbonyl reductase expression.Fig. 3Basal expression of the carbonyl reductase in Mytilus spp. tissues. Tissue samples from mantle, muscle, gills and hepatopancreas of control mussels (without TNT exposure) were processed for mRNA extraction. Primers used for RT-PCR are shown in Table . 18\\u00a0s RNA served as the housekeeping gene\\n\\n\\n\\nCarbonyl reductase gene induction in Mytilus spp. after 96-h TNT lab exposureMussels were exposed to increasing concentrations of TNT for 96\\u00a0h in laboratory aquarium studies. As shown in Figs.\\u00a0 and , TNT caused a concentration-dependent and statistically significant induction of the carbonyl reductase gene in the gills of Mytilus spp., thereby again reflecting the importance of carbonyl reductase in the gills as first-line defence against oxidative stress. Figure\\u00a0 shows a representative RT-PCR experiment (agarose gel) derived from gills with TNT concentrations ranging from 0.31 up to 10\\u00a0mg\\\/L including respective controls (without TNT exposure). Figure\\u00a0 shows the respective densitometric analyses of the RT-PCR agarose gels derived from gills, hepatopancreas, mantle and muscle resulting from the same 96\\u00a0h exposure experiments. Like that in gills, the stress response towards TNT was observed in hepatopancreas, mantle and muscle tissues, but with some variability at higher concentrations compared to gills.Fig. 4Induction of the carbonyl reductase gene in Mytilus spp. gills after a 96-h treatment with TNT\\u2014representative agarose gel. Mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations of TNT (ranging from 0.31 to 10\\u00a0mg\\\/L) for 96\\u00a0h in laboratory aquarium studies.

Fold inductions (means with SD from n\\u2009=\\u20093, except muscle control with n\\u2009=\\u20091) were calculated from the carbonyl reductase expression relative to 18\\u00a0s RNA. Statistically significant changes are indicated by asterisks (*p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, **p\\u2009<\\u20090.01, ***p\\u2009<\\u20090.001; Dunnett\\u2019s T3 multiple comparisons test. No statistical calculation for muscle was performed because of n\\u2009=\\u20091 in the control group)\\n\\n\\n\\nCarbonyl reductase gene induction in Mytilus spp. after 21-day TNT lab exposureMussels were exposed to increasing concentrations of TNT for 21\\u00a0days in laboratory aquarium studies. As shown in Fig.\\u00a0, (densitometric analyses of agarose gels from RT-PCR experiments), TNT, compared to control, caused a clear induction of the carbonyl reductase gene in the gills, hepatopancreas, mantle and muscle tissues of the mussels which was highly significant in gills at 0.62 and 2.5\\u00a0mg\\\/L TNT concentrations. The lack of statistical significance in some of the columns, despite clear indications for carbonyl reductase gene induction, is due to the low amount of tissue obtained (which was a challenge upon preparation). Anyway, when looking at the y-axes it turns out that indeed gills and hepatopancreas are the tissues responsible for providing oxidative stress response.Fig. 6Induction of the carbonyl reductase in Mytilus spp. tissues after a 21-day treatment with TNT\\u2014densitometric analyses. Mussels were exposed to increasing concentrations of TNT (ranging from 0.31 to 2.5\\u00a0mg\\\/L) for 21\\u00a0days in laboratory aquarium studies.

The primers used for RT-PCR are shown in Table . 18\\u00a0s RNA served as the housekeeping gene.

Statistically significant changes are indicated by asterisks (*p\\u2009<\\u20090.05, **p\\u2009<\\u20090.01, ***p\\u2009<\\u20090.001, ****p\\u2009<\\u20090.0001; Dunnett\\u2019s T3 multiple comparisons test was used for the calculation of the gills and hepatopancreas results, Dunn\\u2019s multiple comparisons test for the calculation of the mantle and muscle results)\\n\\n\\n\\nField studies at Kolberger Heide\\u2013caging experimentsWith the help of scientific divers, mussels were exposed in mussel bags at the munitions dumping ground Kolberger Heide near a chunk of hexanite. One bag was placed at the ground directly adjacent to a chunk of explosive material (7 U), the other at a height of one meter (7 O). This is important because mussel exposure towards TNT and its metabolites could be expected to be higher at 7 U compared to 7 O (Strehse et al. ; Maser and Strehse ). Mussels were recovered after 58\\u00a0days and analysed for carbonyl reductase expression. Indeed, induced gene expression of carbonyl reductase was statistically significant higher (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) in 7U mussels compared to 7 O mussels (Fig.\\u00a0). Corresponding to the results from lab aquarium exposure, gills and hepatopancreas were the most responsive tissues compared to the mantle. Of note: Muscle tissue could not be obtained from any mussel.Fig. 7Induction of the carbonyl reductase in Mytilus spp. exposed in a munition dumping ground. Mussels were exposed in a field study at the ground directly adjacent to a chunk of explosive material (7 U) or at a height of one meter (7 O). After recovery (58\\u00a0days exposure) mussel tissued were analysed for carbonyl reductase expression. Primers used for RT-PCR are shown in Table . a Agarose gels showing three replicates of PCR fragments per tissue; b Densitometric analysis of the gels shown in (a) (means with SD from n\\u2009=\\u20093).

Statistically significant changes are indicated by asterisks (**p\\u2009<\\u20090.01; unpaired t-test with Welch\\u2019s correction)\\n\\n\\n\\nOccurrence of explosive chemicals in mussel tissuesAll mussels of the current study were examined for their tissue content of explosive chemicals by GS\\\/MS analysis. In all mussels from the lab exposure studies, TNT itself as well as its metabolites 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT were found, while mussels from the control group were free of detectable amounts of explosive chemicals (Table ). Generally, in all groups values for 4-ADNT were higher than values for 2-ADNT, whereas TNT was found in only low amounts. This points to an extensive transformation of TNT to 2- and 4-ADNT within the mussels during the exposure experiments. Interestingly, the sum of TNT and metabolites determined within the mussels tissue reflects the initial TNT concentration in the aquaria, i.e. increasing TNT exposure led to higher tissue concentrations of the explosive chemicals TNT, 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT (Table ).Table 2Mean values (\\u00b1\\u2009SD) of TNT, 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) measured in the tissue of exposed Mytilus spp. obtained from the 96-h and 21-day experiments\\n\\nExposure groups [mg\\\/L]TNT4-ADNT2-ADNT\\u2211 [ng\\\/g]Mean [ng\\\/g]\\u00b1 SDMean [ng\\\/g]\\u00b1 SDMean [ng\\\/g]\\u00b1 SD96-hour exposure study\\u00a00n.d.n.d.n.d.\\u00a00.3125.512.6659.3160.8508.8119.11193.6\\u00a00.6221.613.11287.1402.7866.4348.22175.1\\u00a01.25132.323.32473.8606.32269.7443.14875.8\\u00a02.5363.2396.45601.21813.45154.5198.211118.9\\u00a05594.0578.17199.42846.97017.01244.114810.4\\u00a0101469.9115.030872.8977.325880.9967.658223.621-day exposure study\\u00a00n.d.n.d.n.d.\\u00a00.3130.24.9622.7129.7313.949.3966.8\\u00a00.6241.420.21659.664.51170.4125.52871.4\\u00a01.2549.319.11290.6774.7917.9658.92257.8\\u00a02.5126.533.25247.1266.54288.01874.99661.6\\n\\nTissue concentrations of mussels from the field studies at Kolberger Heide have already been published in Strehse et al. (). In brief, in mussels directly exposed at the ground near a free lying chunk of hexanite, 2-ADNT, 4-ADNT and TNT could be detected with average body burdens of 103.75\\u2009\\u00b1\\u200912.77, 131.31\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20099.53 and 31.04\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20093.26\\u00a0ng\\\/g mussel wet weight, respectively. In mussels placed one meter above the ground at the same position, no TNT and 2-ADNT could be detected, but 4-ADNT was found with an average concentration of 8.71\\u2009\\u00b1\\u20092.88\\u00a0ng\\\/g mussel wet weight. This again points to a transformation of TNT to its 2- and 4-ADNT metabolites.\\n\\nCorrelation between explosive chemical exposure and carbonyl reductase gene inductionInitial TNT concentrations in the exposure aquaria, given as mg\\\/L, in most cases resulted in 3\\u20135\\u00a0fold accumulation of TNT plus metabolites in the corresponding mussels (Table ). This finding led us to perform correlation analyses between tissue and\\\/or water concentrations of explosive chemicals and the extent of carbonyl reductase gene induction. As shown in Fig.\\u00a0, 96\\u00a0h lab exposure to TNT yielded a concentration-dependent correlation towards the ratio of carbonyl reductase gene induction versus 18 sRNA gene induction with a correlation coefficient of R2\\u2009=\\u20090.935 in the gills. Interestingly, correlation studies considering the levels of tissue concentrations of explosive chemicals clearly showed that the maximum of carbonyl reductase gene induction occurs at around 10\\u00a0\\u00b5g explosives (sum of TNT plus 2- and 4-ADNT) per g mussel tissue.Fig. 8Correlation between explosive chemical exposure and carbonyl reductase gene induction. a Ratio of carbonyl reductase (CR) expression vs. 18\\u00a0s RNA expression is plotted against initial TNT concentrations in the exposure aquaria (given in mg\\\/L). b Ratio of carbonyl reductase (CR) expression vs. 18\\u00a0s RNA expression is plotted against tissue concentrations of explosive chemicals (sum of TNT plus 2- and 4-ADNT) per g mussel tissue (wet weight)\\n\\n\\n\\nDiscussionKolberger Heide, a section of the western Kiel Bight at the entrance to Kiel Fjord, Germany, is a warfare contaminated area with extensive research activities. This area has a size of approximately 1.260\\u00a0ha and is located in a distance of three to five nautical miles to the shoreline. It was used as an area for dumping munitions after World War II (B\\u00f6ttcher et al. ). At Kolberger Heide some 30000 tons of German and British ordnance are present (Kampmeier et al. ). In water samples and several species like starfish (Asteroidea sp.), algae and tunicates collected at Kolberger Heide as well as in the bile of dab (Limanda limanda L.) caught in this area, TNT and other explosive residues were found (Gledhill et al. ; Beck et al. ; Koske et al. ).\\n\\nIn previous investigations, we have established the mussel Mytilus spp. as a biomonitoring system to determine explosive chemical contaminations leaking from corroding mines (Strehse et al. ; Appel et al. ; Maser and Strehse ). With this system, we could unequivocally show that explosive residues enter the marine biota in the vicinity of dumped munitions. With respect to TNT toxicity, even moderate concentrations of TNT like those found in the water column at Kolberger Heide may have an impact on the exposed mussels such as decreases in size and weight (Strehse et al. ; Gledhill et al. ). Recently, Schuster et al. () demonstrated multi-level biological effects in Baltic blue mussels (Mytilus spp.) treated with TNT in two laboratory studies. This multi-biomarker approach comprised genetic, cellular and metabolic effects in correlation to TNT exposure were observed. Likewise, elevated levels of unspecific oxidative damages were seen. Nonetheless, neither one of the observed biomarkers alone nor the entire biomarker approach as such were able to serve as a specific indicator for a possible TNT contamination in the marine environment.\\n\\nIn the present investigation we, therefore, focused on the metabolic antioxidant defence system on a molecular level and concentrated on the induction of the carbonyl reductase gene which is known to respond to oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Ebert et al. ). The existence of ROS is an integral part of human and animal life. On the one hand, ROS are actively produced within the metabolism of an organism to fulfil essential vital processes, for example in the citric acid cycle. On the other hand, xenobiotics that constantly enter living individuals can either directly be metabolized to ROS or they cause damages to cell components like DNA, proteins and other essential structures, which may contribute to the formation of ROS as well (Lushchak ). Fortunately, cellular organisms are able to protect themselves with the help of several non-enzymatic and enzymatic mechanisms (Ebert et al. ).\\n\\nHere, carbonyl reducing enzymes play an important role in the defence against cellular damages caused by oxidative stress and ROS, thereby providing neuroprotection against reactive carbonyl compounds (Botella et al. ; Maser ; Ellis ). For example, human carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1; SDR21C1) was first identified in the human brain (Wermuth ) and later shown to play a role in the protection against lipid peroxidation derived reactive aldehydes (Doorn et al. ; Maser ), thereby constituting a defence mechanism against oxidative stress in general and carbonyl stress in more detail (Ebert et al. ). Later, human carbonyl reductase 3 (CBR3; SDR21C2) was characterized (Watanabe et al. ). Interestingly, the model organism Drosophila melanogaster has no carbonyl reductase gene but an unrelated gene called sniffer (Botella et al. ) which was shown to provide protection against carbonyl stress in Drosophila (Martin et al. ). Bioinformatics analyses on another model organism resulted in the identification of the sniffer gene and four additional genes coding for four individual carbonyl reductases, CR1 \\u2013 CR4, in the Daphnia genome (Ebert et al. ). We cloned all four Daphnia carbonyl reductases from D. magna and D. pulex, respectively, and showed their high affinity toward aromatic dicarbonyls including redox cyclers such as phenanthrene quinone, implying their physiological role in the detoxification of quinones (Ebert et al. ).\\n\\nSince the mechanism of toxicity and carcinogenicity of TNT and its derivatives occurs through its capability of inducing oxidative stress in the target biota, we had the idea if TNT can induce the gene expression of carbonyl reductase in blue mussels. As a first step, we were able to identify and clone the gene coding for carbonyl reductase in the blue mussel (Mytilus spp.) (Fig.\\u00a0). The Mytilus carbonyl reductase shares 89% identity to human CBR1 and can be regarded as a functional homolog to human CBR1 because it shares all the essential SDR motifs (Persson et al. ; Martin et al. ). As the second step, blue mussels (Mytilus spp.) were exposed to TNT in two laboratory experiments and in a field study and then investigated in terms of their response in form of carbonyl reductase gene induction. As the third step, we determined the occurrence of TNT and derivatives thereof in the mussel tissues and to relate the concentrations of these explosives to the extent of carbonyl reductase gene induction. Our results indeed indicate that carbonyl reductase is induced upon TNT exposure and could possibly serve as the first molecular biomarker for this explosive compound.\\n\\nMussels were dissected, and gills, hepatopancreas, mantle and muscle tissue were investigated individually for carbonyl reductase gene expression. Especially in the gills, the respiratory organ with intensive blood circulation and first contact with pollutants from the surrounding water, we found significant correlations between TNT exposure and carbonyl reductase gene induction. This indicates a high sensitivity of carbonyl reductase to TNT exposure. Interestingly, the extent of carbonyl reductase gene induction showed a strong correlation to the initial TNT concentrations in the different aquaria. Likewise, carbonyl reductase gene induction was seen for hepatopancreas as the main digestive and metabolic organ in mussels. Basal carbonyl reductase expression could also be observed in mantle and muscle tissue, but compared to gills and hepatopancreas this expression was much weaker and induction was hardly shown. In general, the metabolic activity in mantle and muscle tissues is relatively low, therefore, they served as a comparison for the tissue-dependent basal and induced expression of carbonyl reductase in our study.\\n\\nTo relate the level of gene induction to the content of TNT in the mussel tissues, we determined the tissue concentrations of TNT and metabolites thereof via GC\\u2013MS\\\/MS analysis. Although for the laboratory exposure studies only TNT (2,4,6-trinitrotoluene) itself was dissolved in the aquaria, mussel tissue determination by GC\\u2013MS\\\/MS analysis yielded the two TNT metabolites 2-amino-4,6-dinitrotoluene (2-ADNT) and 4-amino-2,6-dinitrotoluene (4-ADNT) as the principal explosives. This finding does also apply for the field experiment. While in mussels placed directly on the ground, TNT itself, as well as 2- and 4-ADNT was observed, in mussels placed one meter above the seabed at the same position, only 4-ADNT but neither TNT nor 2-ADNT could be detected. It is well known, that transformation processes of parent TNT include photolysis, hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, and biological transformation (Goodfellow et al. ). Apparently, the carbon-2 and carbon-4 nitro moieties of TNT had been reduced as a consequence of microbial metabolism or via conversion by mussel enzymes to 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT, respectively (Hawari et al. ), both in the lab experiment as well as in the field study.\\n\\nA very interesting discovery was made during our field experiment at the dumping site Kolberger Heide. Here, the mRNA expression of carbonyl reductase in the mussels directly exposed at the seabed (7 U in Fig.\\u00a0) was statistically significant induced (p\\u2009<\\u20090.01) in all analyzed tissues (gills, hepatopancreas and mantle) compared to mussels from one meter above at the same mooring. Although the mussels from 7 U and 7 O were only one meter apart from each other, this difference can be explained with the differing TNT water concentrations pattern in this area. Beck et al. () measured a TNT water concentration of 3.1\\u00a0mg\\\/L in water samples directly taken at a chunk of hexanite (7 U). In contrast, already at a 50\\u00a0cm distance only 3.3\\u00a0\\u00b5g\\\/L of TNT could be measured in the water samples.\\n\\nOf note, the TNT concentrations in the water column at the position on the ground (7 U) are more or less comparable to the (higher) concentrations of TNT in the lab studies, indicating that carbonyl reductase gene induction in the field study is indeed a result of the high TNT concentration at this position (7 U). This is supported by the fact that significant carbonyl reductase gene expression occurs already at tissue concentrations below 5\\u00a0\\u00b5g of explosives (sum of TNT plus 2-ADNT and 4-ADNT) per g (wet weight) of mussel tissue.\\n\\nConclusionsTNT leaking from dumped conventional munitions poses a major threat to the marine environment (Nipper et al. ; Ek et al. ). In addition, TNT is known for its mutagenic and carcinogenic effects in humans and may constitute a risk for the human seafood consumer (Bolt et al. ; Maser and Strehse ). However, measured water and\\\/or tissue concentrations alone are not meaningful in context with TNT effects on an organism. Therefore, a selective biomarker to relate the exposure of an organism to TNT to its pathophysiologic effects on a molecular level is urgently needed. The induced expression of the carbonyl reductase gene from the superfamily of short-chain dehydrogenases\\\/reductases found in the present investigation offers a promising approach as a selective biomarker for environmental pollution caused by TNT.\\n\\n\"}\n\nList the chemical-gene interactions as a JSON array of objects"},{"role":"assistant","content":"[{\"ChemicalName\":\"Trinitrotoluene\",\"GeneSymbol\":\"CBR1\",\"GeneForms\":\"mRNA\",\"Organism\":\"Mytilus\",\"Interaction\":\"Trinitrotoluene results in increased expression of CBR1 mRNA\",\"InteractionActions\":\"increases^expression\"}]"}]}
