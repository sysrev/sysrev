Findings indicated that four factors played a role in explaining the level of computer use by principals. These factors included high level of computer access, strong perceptions of the attributes of ICT, high level of computer competence, as well as the high level of transformational leadership behaviors, all contributed significantly to the level of computer use by principals. All four constructs are equally important but have varying impacts on computer use. Therefore, all four constructs should be viewed in an integrated manner in accordance to the conceptual model proposed in this study.

This partial life history, excavated through the tenets of Critical Race Theory (CRT), illuminates the social construction of race and the pervasiveness and permanence of racism. We determined through a series of interviews that the participant's resilient resistance is guided by critical spirituality so that circumstances and people who challenge her also confront this source of power. Her lived experience, from student to faculty member, conveys the challenges and opportunities she faces and adds to the scholarship to better understand anti-oppressive education. As a result of our study we derived implications for practice which include suggested institutional efforts to build support structures for Black women and shift academic culture. Also, there are recommendations which include conducting socially and culturally responsible and responsive mining of the contributions of Black women and providing culturally relevant support to sustain Black woman scholars and practitioners in education and educational leadership at all levels.N1  - Accession Number: EJ960161; Acquisition Information: Negro Educational Review, Inc.

The article argues that leaders can be found at all levels of an organization. Diversifying leadership in the early childhood field means working across cultures, ethnicities, economic status, ages, abilities, regions of the country, experience levels, roles, and segments of the field. Authentic leaders come from and understand the community where the work is based, hold the same values as the population being served, appreciate every participant's assets, and can sense and foster a group's comfort level.N1  - Accession Number: EJ938260; Acquisition Information: Zero to Three. 2000 M Street NW Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036-3307.

The article attempts to identify the challenges facing the two schools in this complex reality and the strategies developed by the two principals and their teaching staff to cope with academic, pedagogic and administrative functioning difficulties. Qualitative data collection and analysis were chosen for this investigation. Interpretation followed the four dimensions suggested by Horsford, Grosland and Gunn (2011) in their Framework for Culturally Relevant Leadership: political contexts, pedagogical approaches, personal journeys and professional duties. Findings indicate that although the schools cope with difficult circumstances in the field, the government's policies are naive and unclear. The principals are motivated by a pedagogy of compassion, containment and humanistic-universal commitment. Conflicting discourses are found among the staff who feel 'trapped' in this difficult reality. The principals employ a style that encourages synergistic collective commitment and social cohesion. Conclusions and recommendations are discussed.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1232577; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Yet, some school leaders are not culturally responsive and make uncritical or intentional decisions that disadvantage certain students. This has implications for students marginalized by the dominant culture, especially in contexts of social unrest where culturally irrelevant leadership can reinforce existing social and academic divisions. This research centered on school principals in Northern Mindanao, Philippines. The region has a long history of ethno-religious conflict which has displaced two million people and killed 160,000 people over the last 40Â years. The purpose of this research was to explore how and in what ways school principals in Northern Mindanao are culturally (ir)relevant leaders. One research question guided this inquiry: How and in what ways do school principals in Northern Mindanao understand and practice culturally relevant leadership? The research findings make explicit the importance of meaningful principal preparation and professional development programs that interweave culturally relevant leadership skills, reflective practice, and inter-cultural understanding in ways that can be locally applied.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1218703; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

However, it is then argued that distributed leadership per se does not necessarily imply a commitment to a particular stance on issues of social justice, such as equality, but rather that this can only flow from leaders becoming culturally responsive to the diverse traditions and needs of the changing populations of their schools. We define this combination as 'distributed culturally responsive leadership'. The second part of the paper attempts to illustrate this argument by closely examining the philosophy and actions of a particular principal who is regarded as an exemplar of good practice. The methodology used in the school case study is described and, finally, we provide a presentation and analysis of the data followed by a discussion of the research findings.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1211370; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

John Robert Browne II shows how Culturally Courageous Leadership by all school community stakeholders can help you achieve equitable learning opportunities and outcomes for all students. This practical guide: (1) Shows how to develop realistic, data-based plans for putting equity initiatives into action; (2) Helps district and school administrators work with teacher, parent, student, and community leaders to advance equity and excellence; (3) Provides concrete examples of what it takes to empower staff and stakeholders through collaborative leadership; and (4) Offers tips on how to navigate the politics when addressing the interface between identity, race, culture, poverty, primary language, and achievement. School-based examples, role-play activities, profiles of educators exemplifying leadership for equity, "make it personal" questions, facilitator notes, and diagnostic assessments are provided so you can engage your entire school or district community in equity transformation. If you are ready to take on the challenge of becoming an "equity warrior," then "Walking the Equity Talk" will show you the path forward.N1  - Accession Number: ED534331; Intended Audience: Administrators; Acquisition Information: Corwin, A SAGE Publications Company. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

It looks at how positive cultures can be constructed that support inclusive and exciting teaching, enthusiastic teachers and engaged students, parents and carers. Drawing on research, the book examines topics such as the nature of leadership, especially distributed and teacher leadership; the politics of education management; the construction of inclusive cultures in schools; school improvement; and the construction of collaborative and inclusive work groups. It uses a range of critical perspectives to examine processes of change and the relationships of people in school communities to each other and to their social, economic and policy contexts. The book argues that it is essential to develop inclusive education in order to promote student engagement, social justice and equity within formal education. It contains the following 10 chapters: (1) Considering Schools as Organisations and Communities; (2) Mediating the External Policy Contexts of Schools; (3) Where Power Lies within Schools; (4) School Leaders as Politicians: Governing in Whose Interests?; (5) The Heart of the Matter: The Moral Dilemmas of Working in Educational Settings; (6) Creating Cultures: Facilitating Engagement; (7) Leading and Constructing the Curriculum; (8) Developing Cultures of Learning in Subject Areas; (9) Strategies of Success at Middle Leader Level; and (10) Leading Purposeful Change in Schools: People Power and Culture.N1  - Accession Number: ED493271; Intended Audience: Students; Teachers; Administrators; Practitioners; Policymakers; Acquisition Information: Open University Press.

This policy brief details why increasing diversity in K-12 school leadership can improve overall diversity in the teacher workforce and work to support empowered schools.N1  - Accession Number: ED580900; Language: English; Education Level: Elementary Secondary Education; Reference Count: 22; Journal Code: APR2018; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 2018PB  - Online SubmissionJF  - Online SubmissionUR  - http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=ED580900&site=ehost-liveM1  - ReportER  - TY  - JOURID  - 256382A1  - Crooks, Claire V.A1  - Burleigh, DawnA1  - Snowshoe, AngelaA1  - Lapp, AndreaA1  - Hughes, RayA1  - Sisco, AshleyT1  - A Case Study of Culturally Relevant School-Based Programming for First Nations Youth: Improved Relationships, Confidence and Leadership, and School SuccessY1  - 2015Y2  - 01/01VL  - 8IS  - 4SP  - 216EP  - 230KW  - Canada NativesKW  - Foreign CountriesKW  - Indigenous PopulationsKW  - Culturally Relevant EducationKW  - Mixed Methods ResearchKW  - Program EvaluationKW  - Elementary School StudentsKW  - Elementary School TeachersKW  - Secondary School StudentsKW  - Secondary School TeachersKW  - PrincipalsKW  - InterviewsKW  - Interpersonal RelationshipKW  - Academic AchievementKW  - Student School RelationshipKW  - Self EsteemKW  - Leadership QualitiesKW  - Role ModelsKW  - Program EffectivenessKW  - TribesKW  - MentorsKW  - Case StudiesKW  - SurveysKW  - CanadaAB  - Schools are expected to promote social and emotional learning skills among youth; however, there is a lack of culturally-relevant programming available. The Fourth R: Uniting Our Nations programs for Aboriginal youth include strengths-based programs designed to promote healthy relationships and cultural connectedness, and improve school success during the transition from elementary to secondary school. A mixed methods evaluation of these programs was undertaken utilizing 35 elementary and secondary student interviews, survey data from 45 secondary students, and 7 educator, and principal interviews. Four themes emerged: (1) programming was perceived to contribute to student success; (2) participants experienced improved relationships, and an increased sense of belonging; (3) participants gained confidence and leadership skills; and (4) the provision of culturally relevant experiences and role models was key to program success. The results underscore the importance of developing and implementing culturally relevant programs for Aboriginal youth, who as a group have been historically marginalized in the education system. Furthermore, promoting cultural connectedness in schools facilitates the development of bicultural competence, and reduces the pressure many of these youth experience to choose between success at school and their Aboriginal identity.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1090231; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

Using qualitative data collected through a case study of the Legacy Academic Enrichment program in Middletown, Ohio, I identify factors that make Legacy sustainable and successful in a community that has experienced significant educational challenges and decline in recent years. The findings of this research include six (6) major components: culturally responsive teaching; community mobilization; building trust and agency; gauging community need; leveraging community resources; and participatory planning. I also explore these six (6) program components that inspire and sustain leaders of the program given the state of education in the community. The research question that guides this analysis is: How does Legacy, a community-based academic enrichment program, build and use civic capacity?

The researcher determined that the potential existed for this participant, who was actively working to address issues brought on by diversity, to serve as a role model for culturally-responsive teaching through a case study. The increasing diversity among prekindergarten to Grade 12 students requires a more adequately trained, culturally aware faculty and staff. This case study used the theoretical lenses of the critical race theory, the model of Black identity development, and White identity development to examine the experiences of diverse cultures upon academic social structures. Four main research questions guided this study to determine the principal's ability to lead in a multicultural urban setting effectively: (a) what are the principal's perceptions about cultural awareness and his/her responsibility for serving increasingly diverse students, staff, and communities; (b) in what ways does a principal's perceptions of his/her capacity to lead effectively and demonstrate cultural awareness in an urban school with increasingly diverse students, staff, and communities evolve in practice over time; (c) what are the principal's perceptions of their past effectiveness to lead in a culturally responsive manner while serving increasingly diverse students, staff, and communities; and (d) what are the principal's perceptions of their preparedness to lead in a culturally responsive and culturally competent manner while serving increasingly diverse students, staff, and communities. School principals play a critical role in improving schools. This in-depth study interviewed a principal that had demonstrated 3 years of effective multicultural leadership experience over a diverse ethnic and gender population of students within the public urban school system.

This in-depth, qualitative study explored the experiences of five Black male students in the Black Male Leadership Collective (BMLC), a Black male initiative program at a midsized historically White 4-year institution. In particular, we used Museus' (2014) culturally engaging campus environment model as a conceptual frame to analyze and understand the men's experiences in the BMLC. While providing personal narratives, the students expressed how the BMLC served as a culturally enriching environment and contributed positively to their overall college experience. Students attributed their participation in the BMLC to three critical factors that improved their college tenures: gaining brotherhood through their Black male peer-to-peer bonding (cultural familiarity, collectivist cultural orientations, and cultural community service), being provided with and enmeshed in a support network (culturally validating environment, humanized educational environment, and holistic support), and enhancing their personal development (culturally relevant knowledge and proactive philosophies). As the student narratives attest, each of these elements, individually and collectively, augmented their engagement on campus and supported their resilience and persistence to graduation. Implications for supporting Black male collegians through similar programs are addressed.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1236392; Acquisition Information: American Psychological Association.

Davis began her tenure needing to mend relationships with the local Tribe and community after the district's governing board decided to reconstitute the school. The school's previous principal and site council made decisions that alienated the community and Tribe. Through the implementation of culturally relevant leadership and drawing on community funds of knowledge, Davis transformed a failing school into a high achieving school; however, budget deficits risk tarnishing hard-won relationships and progress that was made. This study explores this dilemma. (Contains 3 notes.)N1  - Accession Number: EJ983233; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Research Design: Data were collected over 4 years at an Islamic K-8 school in the United States and included the following: 12 in-depth semistructured interviews with school and community leaders; 4 phone interviews; 7 focus group interviews with teachers, students, and parents; 5 observations of classroom and school events; and documents from the Islamic center, school, and classrooms. Data specific to the school leaders were analyzed using tenets of CRL. Findings and Conclusions: This article describes how Muslim and non-Muslim leaders in an Islamic school engaged in the tenets of CRL. This study suggests that the tenets of CRL, in this context, were grounded in inter and intrafaith dialogue, cultural syncretism, and a unique focus on the development of an American Muslim identity.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1232734; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

To achieve these outcomes, university preparation programs must adequately train and develop aspiring school leaders with the knowledge, skills, and capacity needed to be effective leaders. This qualitative case study examines a nuanced space of school leadership by examining the transformative formal educational experiences of teachers that participated in an emerging leaders pilot program. The emerging leaders pilot program was imagined and implemented after a sustained conversation and mutual partnership between the university and the local school district in order to cultivate future district leadership. This study highlights the various components that have informed and impacted the development and practice of its participants. Two educators that participated in the emerging leaders cohort and three university and school district leaders comprise the units of analysis. Additional observables in the form of audio recordings, course syllabi, and student writings are integrated to provide a more comprehensive description of the program and its overall impact. The observables were analyzed using a hybrid ecological framework that integrated the concepts of self, organization, and community with the three learning domains of the emerging leaders program: instructional leadership; culturally relevant teaching and leading; and community engagement. The findings of the study highlight the importance cultivating institutional investment, harnessing the power of relationships, implementing dynamic curricula and pedagogy, and constructing a dynamic process for selection of program candidates.

While the retreat appeared to have positive lasting impacts on many of the participants, it seemed to have the greatest impact on those who already displayed Eurocentric leadership skills; it had little effect on those who did not display these skills prior to retreat participation and it focused on North American, Eurocentric approaches to leadership. By becoming more culturally relevant, we argue that the retreat could have broader impacts on a greater number of Aboriginal youth.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1192410; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

This article revisits the literature examining the cultural gap that exists in public education, while taking a closer look at what it means to be a culturally responsive leader and teacher. The need to integrate culturally responsive practices to connect and encourage success for our increasingly diverse student population continues to persist (Gay, 2000, 2010; Ladson-Billings, 2001, 2009). This study examined the experiences and reflections of six educational leadership candidates while they mentored teacher candidates. The candidates were also women of colour (Black and/or Latina), who were selected by faculty based on academic performance. Using literature focused on cultural responsibility pedagogy and leadership, the educational leadership candidates attempted to apply culturally responsive practices both as the role of future administrator and instructional leader throughout their clinical experiences. The action research method allowed educational leadership candidates to serve as the researchers and participants actively searching for better or different routes to culturally lead and teach effectively in inner city school predominantly taught and led by white teachers and principals. The educational leadership candidates and the teacher candidates engaged in lively discourse about pedagogy, practice, and support that promoted cultural responsibility. The data included observations, informal interviews and reflective analysis based on the literature used during the semester.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1112315; Acquisition Information: Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc. 5/202 Coode Street, Como, Western Australia 6152, Australia. e-mail: editor@iier.org.au; Web site: http://www.waier.org.au; Language: English; Education Level: Elementary EducationSecondary Education; Reference Count: 65; Journal Code: APR2018; Level of Availability: Not available from ERIC; Publication Type: Academic Journal; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 2016PB  - Issues in Educational ResearchJF  - Issues in Educational ResearchSN  - 1837-6290AV  - Western Australian Institute for Educational Research Inc. 5/202 Coode Street, Como, Western Australia 6152, Australia. e-mail: editor@iier.org.au; Web site: http://www.waier.org.auUR  - http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1112315&site=ehost-live; http://www.iier.org.au/iier26/genao.pdfM1  - Journal ArticleER  - TY  - JOURID  - 256423A1  - Gibson, Taji L.A1  - Decker, Janet R.T1  - Failure to Focus on the Discipline of Black Girls: Encouraging School Leaders to Initiate ConversationsY1  - 2019Y2  - 12/01VL  - 22IS  - 4SP  - 80EP  - 98KW  - African American StudentsKW  - BlacksKW  - Minority Group StudentsKW  - FemalesKW  - Student NeedsKW  - Discipline PolicyKW  - Racial BiasKW  - Gender BiasKW  - Cultural RelevanceKW  - African American CultureKW  - Cultural DifferencesKW  - Cultural AwarenessKW  - Educational EnvironmentKW  - PrincipalsKW  - Administrator RoleKW  - Teacher RoleKW  - School CultureAB  - Although increasing attention has been given to the disproportionate discipline of Black students in general, the specific needs of Black girls have often been overlooked. This article encourages school leaders to analyze how discipline policies are often problematic for Black girls. The article provides a case narrative to illustrate the issue and describes current discipline policy trends. The article recommends school leaders attend not only to implicit biases, but also to their legal requirements to protect Black girls from uneven, culturally biased practices. The article concludes with "Teaching Notes" instructing leaders how to hold courageous conversations to support Black girls.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1233439; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Drawing upon the concept of parallel leadership in schools proposed by Crowther, Kaagan, Ferguson, and Hann as an example, the purpose of this paper is to examine the notion that Western educational leadership theories are universal in applicability in a Singapore school context. According to Crowther "et al.", parallel leadership is a process where school principals and teacher leaders engage in collective action to enhance school capacity through mutual respect, a shared sense of purpose and celebrating individual variations and differences. This interaction involves deep cognitive learning as well as social, moral, aesthetic and spiritual aspects of learning and development. By way of understanding of cultural values, it is not surprising to note that educational leadership theories are in fact "culture-bound". Culture is essentially related to environmental factors, assumptions and constraints. In other words, the cross-cultural transferability of educational leadership theories and practices is subject to the degree of similarities between the cultures. It is paramount to be cautious of the adoption of Western "cultural bound" theories in the local school contexts.

This dissertation employs three emerging methodologies, namely three-step latent class analysis (LCA), multilevel latent class analysis (MLCA), and meta-narrative review, to examine typologies of teachers and their perceptions of technology use and technology leadership with large-scale, quantitative data and to offer a conceptual framework of school and district technology leadership through a culturally responsive lens. The first study utilized latent class analysis (LCA) with the NCES "Fast Response Survey System" Teachers' Use of Educational Technology in U.S. Public Schools, 2009 (FRSS 95) dataset (n = 2,764) to identify four different types of technology-using teachers: "Dexterous, Presenters, Assessors, and Evaders." I also found that teachers in low-income schools are more likely to be in the teacher subgroups that use technology in less impactful ways in the classroom. The second study used multilevel latent class analysis (MLCA) with the 2011-12 Texas "School Technology and Readiness (STaR)" Charts ( n = 6,935 schools in n = 910 districts) to find three subgroups of teacher perceptions of technology leadership at the school level, "High STaR Schools", "Moderate STaR Schools", and "Low STaR Schools", and four subgroups of teacher perceptions of technology leadership at the district level, "Model STaR Districts", "High STaR Districts", "Moderate STaR Districts", and "Low STaR Districts". I found that the Texas teachers in the school and district level subgroups with the lowest perceptions of technology leadership had the lowest student achievement outcomes and were more likely to serve students from historically minoritized backgrounds. The third study employed a systematic, meta-narrative review of the research literature exploring the intersection of technology, leadership, and culturally responsive education, integrating the findings from sixty studies into a conceptual framework of "technology leadership for social justice". Each of the three dissertation articles explores the implications for the development of a more evidence-based, sociocultural conception of school and district technology leadership in research, policy, and practice.

This instrument, which is called the Culturally Responsive Practice Scale (CRPS), includes items that reflect ways that teachers teach multicultural students in their classrooms. To accomplish the goal, three studies are presented in this dissertation. In chapter 1, the study sought to develop the initial instrument to measure the construct of culturally responsive practice among teachers in secondary schools in South Korea. Based on the results of analyzing the literatures about culture-oriented pedagogy and of review of the initial items by professionals, the face and content validity has been demonstrated. In addition, the statistical analysis results provided evidence of reliability of the scale of CRP with strong Cronbach values ranging from 0.93 to 0.95. The multidimensional factor structure of the CRP scale received support from the results of EFA and CFA, which yielded the construct validity for the measurement. Finally, the study suggested that the multidimensional construct of CRP has four distinct components: (a) Recognizing student diversity; (b) Acknowledging family background; (c) Teacher efficacy; and (d) Teaching application. Throughout the process of developing the scale, CRP has evidences supporting its validity, especially in face and content validity and construct validity. In the chapter 2, the study aimed to examine the structural relationships among leadership, organizational learning, and culturally responsive practice and to test the mediating effect of organizational learning between leadership and culturally responsive practice. This process also sought evidence for criterion-related validity of the CRP scale. By using structural equation modeling (SEM), confirmatory factor analysis was run to test whether the proposed factor structure and the scales represent the reality. After confirming the measurement model, the causal relationship among organizational learning, transformational leadership, shared instructional leadership, and culturally responsive practice were tested by using SEM, and confirmed by good values of model fit indices ("xsuperscript 2]/df" = 2.19, NFI = 0.976 , TLI = 0.954, CFI = 0.972, RMSEA = 0.057, p < 0.001). Finally, the mediating role of organizational learning between principal leadership and culturally responsive practice was tested by decomposing the effects among the four latent variables. The results from the relationship of CRP with school variables offer evidences for criterion-related validity of the CRP scale. The chapter 3 examined not only how the constructs of organizational learning, principal leadership, and culturally responsive practice are related to student achievement in schools, but explored the evidence of predictive validity for CRP. The results show that all school level variables except transformational leadership are statistically significant correlated to student achievement. In addition, the result that mathematics and English as foreign language are correlated to CRP offer tentative evidence for predictive validity of the CRP scale.

They vary in language skills as well as their understanding of U.S. culture. All of this affects their ability, if not inclination, to become engaged in their children's education. Educators can assist families by understanding the stages of immigrant parent involvement, which identifies parents' needs, skills, and interests as they move through the stages of Cultural Survivor, Cultural Learner, Cultural Connector, or Cultural Leader. Understanding these stages better equips educators to identify where families are as well as their unique challenges, and helps determine how to best support them.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1083174; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

The state of Hawai'i has been a fertile ground for culture-based development experiences for emerging leaders from islands throughout the Pacific. These opportunities arise from the recognition of dissonance created by customary leadership programs which often give little or no attention to native cultures of the Pacific islands and prioritize other models. This essay highlights elements of my Chamoru culture that form the foundation of a culturally responsive leadership praxis within the context of American educational institutions. I offer this as an example that may help others develop their own culturally sustaining practices and inspire creation of leadership development programs which honor native cultures while facilitating effective professional practices in mainstream settings.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1116782; Acquisition Information: MDPI AG.

The program's design and implementation goals were embodied in two questions. What experiences should be included in a short-term international practicum for preservice educators? How did the implementation unfold? Six participants, five pre-service administrators, and one pre-service teacher participated in the 2016 pilot program in China. The meeting of program learning objectives and gains in global competencies and cultural responsiveness were evident from language test pass-rates and post-experience reflections. The program's creation and implementation resulted primarily from employing university-based Educator to Educator resources. This paper provides a blueprint for leveraging similar resources and partnerships to create and implement valuable and meaningful learning experiences in which students can explore their world beyond the classroom.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1210841; Acquisition Information: Phi Beta Delta, Honor Society for International Scholars.

Three major themes emerged that enabled these leaders to address racism in their schools and create spaces that were more conducive to the practice of culturally responsive pedagogy. The study highlights how leaders reconcile cultural clashes and confront racism by using identity, relationality, and renormed practices.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1104939; Acquisition Information: International Journal of Multicultural Education.

The text explores how equitable collaboration entails ongoing processes that begin with families and communities, transform power, build reciprocity and agency, and foster collective capacity through collective inquiry. These processes offer promising possibilities for improving student learning, transforming educational systems, and developing robust partnerships that build on the resources, expertise, and cultural practices of nondominant families. Based on empirical research and inquiry-driven practice, this book describes core concepts and provides multiple examples of effective practices. Book Features: (1) Broadens the dominant conception of leadership to include traditionally marginalized parents and communities as potential educational leaders; (2) Explores partnerships from both a systemwide and in-school basis, with detailed portraits of what is possible; (3) Translates theoretical principles at multiple scales: systemic, school, and individual practice; and (4) Shares studies focused on a broad range of contexts, strategies, and practices for enacting equitable collaboration with families.N1  - Accession Number: ED600851; Acquisition Information: Teachers College Press. 1234 Amsterdam Avenue, New York, NY 10027.

Similar to the diversity in other countries, where leaders demonstrate culturally responsive leadership practices in their quest to educate diverse democracies. This inquiry examines the characteristics and behaviours of effective leadership for social justice and equity for student academic achievement in urban Auckland primary schools. A qualitative, comparative case study, combined with the theoretical framework of applied critical leadership from theories of transformational leadership, critical pedagogy and critical race theory (perspective lens) guided the research methods. The research findings presented several applied critical leadership characteristics that highlighted the complexities of leading for social justice in urban Auckland primary schools. A distinct phenomenon was leader's axiological philosophy (values, beliefs and morals) underpinning their leadership that was culturally responsive to the diversity in their educational contexts. These findings suggest the need for research and scholarship yet to be done in this largely unexplored educational leadership academic space.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1116901; Acquisition Information: MDPI AG.

In addition to a review of relevant literature from various academic disciplines (e.g., sociology, anthropology, economics, political science) to provide background and develop a shared vocabulary and conceptual frameworks, the course combines academic texts engaging salient issues of policy and practice in rural education with appropriately positioned fictional representations of rural contexts to provide a common foundation for discussing the interrelationships between rural communities and rural schools.

In this paper, we highlight a participatory approach to develop culturally and contextually competent programs to enhance international student adjustment and engagement. We combined findings from the Acculturative Stress Scale of International Students (ASSIS) with interviews eliciting international student concerns and ideas for programming. On the ASSIS, randomly selected international students (n=40) expressed high levels of acculturative stress. These students, along with key informants (n=5) and international student leaders (n=8) formed focus groups, and provided suggestions for programs. Based on these formative results, we developed and described a variety of programs. Our experiences with participatory approaches suggest a promising avenue for enhancing cultural and contextual competence in international student programming.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1197359; Acquisition Information: Journal of International Students. 4005 Spurgeon Drive #6, Monroe, LA 71203.

In this essay I extend the tenets of culturally responsive leadership beyond the school site to encompass community-based educational leadership that advocates for cultural recognition, revitalization, and community development. I provide historical examples of educational leaders from three global cities--New York City, London, and Toronto--and discuss how their actions as public intellectuals, "boundary spanners," and advocacy leaders linked community activism with culture-based curriculum in three national contexts. In the end, I discuss the implications of this framework for leadership preparation.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1131416; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

Frankenberg & Orfield (2012) explain that suburban schools are struggling with the realization that their schools are more racially/ethnically and socio-economically diverse. Further difficulties arise when teachers see race, ethnic or socio-economic differences from a deficit point of view, one where a child's culture, home life and perspectives are viewed negatively (Terrell & Lindsey, 2009). Lack of cultural understanding leads educators to underappreciate family and cultural belief systems as well as academic potential of minority students (Nelson & Guerra, 2014). As a result, districts are failing to close the achievement gap that exists between white students and minority students and students in poverty (Ladson-Billings, 2006). Extended training in culturally responsive teaching is necessary to shift a deficit mindset to one of full appreciation and advocacy for what students' race and socio-economic status add to the classroom (Ebersol, Kanahele-Mossman & Kawakami, 2015; Terrell & Lindsey, 2009). The purpose of this qualitative study is to explore the role of professional learning in developing cultural proficiency among teachers and building leaders and its impact on instructional practices that are responsive to the needs of racially and ethnically diverse student groups and students of poverty. Through the lens of cultural proficiency (Terrell & Lindsey, 2009), and Learning Forward Standards for Professional Learning, (Mizell, Hord, Killion & Hirsh, 2011) the researcher used a phenomenological approach to research and conducted interviews with a district administrator/coordinator of professional development, a principal, eleven teachers (elementary and/or middle school and/or high school) in three suburban districts in upstate New York. The findings of this study reveal that professional development was aimed at increasing educators' sensitivity and responsiveness toward English Language Learners, special education students, people of color and families living in poverty. Interview narrative revealed that these districts adhered to most tenets of the Learning Forward Standards for Professional Learning by partnering with teachers to develop job embedded, ongoing professional development offered in a variety of formats with internal and external expertise. Educators in these suburban districts, trained in cultural proficiency, were dedicated to increasing the likelihood of school readiness and creating opportunities to share and celebrate cultural differences. All three districts plan to continue to provide professional development that breaks down implicit bias, provides best practices for low SES students, special education students and ELLs.

The goals were: (a) to explore how the school leadership team perceived culturally responsive leadership in a K-12 charter school in North Carolina, (b) to explore how the teachers perceived culturally responsive teaching and learning in a K-12 charter school in North Carolina, and (c) to explore how parents perceived a culturally responsive home-school connection in a K-12 charter school in North Carolina. Because this study involved an examination of stakeholders' perceptions of culturally responsive leadership in a charter school, a willing participant pool of charter school stakeholders was needed. Data were gathered through in-depth focus group interviews with three stakeholder groups, school leadership, teachers and parents, in a K-12 public charter school. The study occurred in a K-12 public charter school located in the Triad area of North Carolina that was selected based upon specific criteria. Three themes emerged from the analyses of the data: (a) modeling cultural responsiveness, (b) teaching and learning, and (c) home-school connections. Findings from this study revealed that the school leaders, teachers, and parents were unanimous in their belief that culturally responsive leadership established a welcoming and supportive school culture through instructional leadership and created a sense of belonging for all stakeholders.

"Indiana's Vision of Response to Intervention', the first Special Report in this three-part series issued by the Center for Evaluation & Education Policy (CEEP), introduced the RTI framework as an effective mechanism in the prevention and intervention of both academic and behavioral problems for all students in K-12 education. The report discussed the research and policy impetus for the use of the RTI framework, as well as what the state of Indiana is currently doing to support this new initiative. Specifically, Indiana's Department of Education (IDOE) has devised a framework of RTI that addresses six core components on which to focus: (1) evidence-based curriculum, instruction, intervention, and extension; (2) assessment and progress monitoring; (3) data-based decision making; (4) leadership; (5) family, school, and community partnerships; and (6) cultural responsivity. This second Special Report addresses in greater detail the IDOE's first three core components of RTI as conceived by the IDOE.

The book demonstrates how leaders can engage students, parents, teachers, and communities in ways that positively impact learning by honoring indigenous heritages and local cultural practices. More Muhammad Khalifa explores three basic premises. First, that a full-fledged and nuanced understanding of "cultural responsiveness" is essential to successful school leadership. Second, that cultural responsiveness will not flourish and succeed in schools without sustained efforts by school leaders to define and promote it. Finally, that culturally responsive school leadership comprises a number of crucial leadership behaviors, which include critical self-reflection; the development of culturally responsive teachers; the promotion of inclusive, anti-oppressive school environments; and engagement with students' indigenous community contexts. Based on an ethnography of a school principal who exemplifies the practices and behaviors of culturally responsive school leadership, the book provides educators with pedagogy and strategies for immediate implementation.

This article focuses on culturally responsive leadership practices for students with Hip-Hop identity performatives. This research uses theoretical frameworks from culturally relevant pedagogies and the scholarship that addresses how young students negotiate, perform, and reinvent and reestablish themselves through Hip-Hop culture, literacy, and identity. Such scholarship situates Hip-Hop pedagogies and student identity. This 2-year ethnographic study of an alternative school reports on how a culturally responsive school leader recognized and validated Hip-Hop student identities. Though he was somewhat removed from the Hip-Hop performative himself, the principal was able to create a safe space in which these student identities were able to exist, and in doing so, prevent the visceral impulse toward marginalization and exclusionary practice of Black and Latino Hip-Hop students that so many of his teachers possessed. Thus, the study discusses leadership theory, as it answers the following research question: How can urban school leaders play a role in forging a space for Hip-Hop identity development in the schools they lead? Secondarily it asks -- given the tensions and contestations in representations of Hip-Hop music -- if they should actually do this, and if so, what are the characteristics of such leadership?N1  - Accession Number: EJ1121845; Acquisition Information: De Gruyter.

They spent seven weeks in an orphanage and a commune in Vietnam to provide various services for disabled children and to help constructing a house for the poor villagers respectively. They learned how to cope with challenging environment through developing service leadership, problem solving and communication abilities in a different cultural context. Aims: To reveal what respondents have experienced, reflected and gained through involving in the cross-cultural service exposure project and how such fruitful learning experiences can be enhanced. Sample: All seventeen pre-service teachers involved in the project. Method: Content analysis was conducted on service-learning journals, day logs and writings prepared by the students after the service-learning experience. Results: The analysis based on respondents' reflective writings revealed that the development of genuine relationship among participants through mutual care, their generic skills, leadership abilities and cultural competencies are enhanced while they work collaboratively and support each other to overcome difficulties. Conclusion: As a multicultural service-learning co-curricular activity, participants can acquire new knowledge, change attitudes and develop constructive behaviors through a genuine and caring environment and reflection. They are perceived to attain gains in leadership abilities, cultural competence skills and professional commitment.N1  - Accession Number: EJ893708; Acquisition Information: Hong Kong Teachers' Association. 242 Nathan Road, National Court 7/F, Kowloon, Hong Kong.

This case focuses on preparing principal candidates to address equity issues related to teacher practices that positively impact student achievement with a veteran high school teacher who is failing to respond to her school's shifting demographics. Embedded in the case are additional challenges of leading a rural school. The principal, who is a new principal but previously taught with the teacher, now needs to provide research-based, culturally responsive, actionable feedback aligned to principles of adult learning theory and research-based instructional practices.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1233346; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

Those who argue for greater attention to equity and diversity suggest that all students regardless of their gender, social class, ethnic or racial characteristics must have equal opportunities to learn and be engaged. These realities call for socially just and culturally responsive educational leaders to act and engage in ways that transform school environments into spaces where all students can succeed. This article explores the leadership practices of six school leaders in a large school board in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, their tensions and possibilities faced with the challenges of increasing diversity in their schools and school board. By examining the work of these school leaders (administrators and teacher leaders), we gain deeper insights into culturally responsive leadership. These school leaders could be described as critical, reflective, purposeful, and fearless.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1131395; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

This study utilized an expert panel to create a purposeful sample of low income/minority school leaders using the culturally proficient rubric (Graham & Lindsey, 2011). The schools identified by the expert panel were triangulated with the New York City School Quality Report for alignment. Six schools participated in the study; three schools identified as more culturally responsive, and three schools identified as less culturally responsive. A total of thirty-four educators across three boroughs in New York City middle schools participated in this study. Six administrators and twenty-nine teachers were interviewed. Interviews were conducted individually and as focus groups that consisted of four to five teachers in each group. Publicly available data was collected and analyzed. The responses from interviewees were analyzed to explore the impact of culturally responsive leadership on closing the achievement gap for low- income minority students in low income high minority schools. The findings from this study indicate that most participants believe culturally responsive school leaders have seven identified traits. The traits are: caring and nurturing; providing students with access to information and resources; the provision equity of opportunities, exposing students to enriching experiences, exhibiting moral courage, practicing social justice behaviors, and supporting the school community and aligning curricula to students' culture. When school leaders implement these traits, they positively impact the academic performance of students. The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC.

The authors shadowed Faith, an assistant principal, and did follow-up interviews with her after each day of shadowing. They observed teachers in their classrooms, conducted multiple interviews with teachers and parents, and gathered artifacts from administrative offices, classrooms, and common areas. The authors found that Faith practiced culturally responsive leadership on three levels: personal, environmental, and curricular. Faith's culturally responsive leadership included six themes: caring, building relationships, being persistent and persuasive, being present and communicating, modeling cultural responsiveness, and fostering cultural responsiveness among others.

The results of a 5-year OAH study conducted in the state of Hawai'i with middle school youth has implications for school leaders in the selection and implementation of comprehensive sex education curricula yielding positive outcomes for youth. Methods: A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted across 34 middle school in the state of Hawai'i with 1783 student participants in pre-, post-, and 1-year follow-up surveys to determine effectiveness of a culturally responsive teen pregnancy prevention curriculum, called Pono Choices, specifically developed for youth in Hawai'i. Results: Students receiving the Pono Choices curriculum had significantly higher rates of knowledge gains than students in control schools, although there were no statistically significant differences in initiation of sexual activity between the groups at the 1-year follow-up. Teachers implemented the curriculum at high rates of adherence to fidelity making this a model for implementation.

Design/methodology/approach: The data pull from a six-month long case study of a mid-sized, Midwestern school district that was attempting to implement culturally responsive leadership practices. After axial coding, findings emerged from interview data and field notes. Findings: Instructional leaders can play significant and useful roles in promoting culturally responsive teaching and pedagogy in schools. Districts can establish positions in which instructional leaders can work to strengthen the culturally responsive pedagogy of every teacher in a district. Research limitations/implications: This study has implications for both research and practice. Culturally responsive school leadership (CRSL) exists in multiple spaces and at various levels in a district. CRSL is not only a school-level function, but it can also be a district-level practice. Culturally responsive instructional leaders (in this case, not principals, but coaches) can have significant impact in promoting culturally relevant pedagogy. Originality/value: This contribution moves beyond school leadership and examines how district leadership practices and decisions foster culturally relevant practices and the challenges in employing this equity work.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1196538; Acquisition Information: Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

Unconscious racism and our lack of ability to confront it present the most salient reason for the indefatigable prevalence of inequitable opportunities for children of color which undeniably result in achievement gaps. This study identified specific culturally responsive practices schoolwide in a middle school that is successfully closing academic opportunity gaps between White and Black students. The findings indicate professional development served as a conduit for ongoing discussions on race and building the cultural competency of staff. These discussions served to promote culturally responsive practices found in leadership, parent engagement, learning environment, and pedagogy.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1069396; Acquisition Information: Academic and Business Research Institute. 147 Medjool Trail, Ponte Vedra, FL 32081.

As this occurs, there is an increasing number of students, specifically students of colour, who are being jettisoned out of the educative process. When school principals have little autonomy regarding how they handle disciplinary infractions within their schools, it becomes relatively easy for them to opt out of making tough decision. The authors assert that Culturally Relevant Leadership is a framework that, if applied correctly, can help school leaders reduce the multiple school suspensions and expulsions that are occurring among students of colour.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1044291; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

An appreciable achievement gap exists in science performance, affecting racial minorities disproportionately. This reality forecasts a continuation of the already dismal representation for racial minorities in the STEM workforce. This dissertation investigates the policy, curricular and professional development practices of school leaders in Florida that experienced exceptional success educating students classified as racial minorities in science. Following a review of literature on the achievement gap and culturally responsive school leadership, a qualitative research project engaged state, district and school level leaders to address the central phenomenon, the methods of governance deployed in some of Florida's most proficient schools for eighth grade minoritized student achievement. The study also examined the recommended best practices of leadership from the National Science Teachers Association (2016) within seven purposively selected high achieving schools where the eighth-grade science achievement gap was reversed. A multi-method research design was developed and utilized phenomenological, grounded theory and multiple case study methodologies. An ex-post facto analysis of state and national data, along with the qualitative techniques of interview, questionnaire, focus group, and document analysis were used to triangulate the information collected. Seven schools that reversed the eighth-grade science achievement gap were selected. Following several iterations of data collection and a detailed coding process, nine best practices of policy, curriculum, and professional development were identified. Additionally, two emerging themes, higher expectations and a commitment to serving all students as needed attributed to the participant schools' successes. This research is especially relevant to state leaders, superintendents, district leaders in science, and all personnel seeking to educate students who have previously underperformed.

During the 2011-2012 school year, a team of teachers and principals began a three-year long effort to provide job-embedded professional development intended to focus on delivering high-impact strategies to transform the educational practices of teachers through improving cultural competence. A survey was given to 120 fulltime certified teachers, and findings suggest that while teachers agreed most that the professional development helped examine views on poverty, they agreed least that the professional development helped close the achievement gap. Additionally, elective and special education teachers were significantly more positive than core subject classroom teachers in terms of how the research they read improved instruction and how the professional development provided impacted building-wide faculty instruction. Analysis of open-ended items highlight several themes, namely the professional development helped teachers by acknowledging cultural differences of the students they taught, but that ultimately the challenges of lack of time and implementation apathy impeded the success of the professional development effort. These findings provide important insight for leadership preparation, particularly about supporting teacher-driven efforts, facilitating culturally responsive practices, and the reflecting on the pressures teachers face due to high stakes accountability and reform efforts.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1103652; Acquisition Information: NCPEA Publications.

Using the theoretical frameworks of Black and White racial identity development (Helms, 1990), Critical Race Theory (Delgado & Stefancic, 2001), and Wijeyesinghe's (2001) Factor Model of Multiracial Identity the researcher sought to understand the process, challenges, and strategies Black college men employ as they emerge as leaders at predominantly White colleges. Specifically the researcher sought to answer the following research question: What is the process by which Black men become leaders of predominately White organizations on predominately White college campuses? Additionally the researcher sought to answer three secondary questions: What support systems do successful Black leaders develop and utilize? What challenges do Black men face in the leadership development process? What coping mechanisms do Black men develop when they encounter challenges in the leadership development process? The researcher interviewed nine Black men at two large research universities in the southeastern United States who held leadership positions for a minimum of one year in at least one predominantly White organization. Using grounded theory methods of analysis, the Black Male Leadership Emergence on Predominately White Campuses (BMLEPWC) model emerged from participant stories. The BMLEPWC is comprised of five multi-dimensional process elements that describe the emergence of leadership for the participants. The model chronicles a process that contained five thematic elements: the African American community, emerging leadership, threats to leadership emergence, strategies for leadership success, and establishing a leader identity. Each of the elements contained multiple thematic dimensions that illustrated a process originating in the support of the African American community proceeding through exploration of opportunities and cultural difference, developing strategies to counteract threats of bias, and resulting in a leader identity focused on social justice and representing a broad and inclusive campus community. Results indicated the need for a greater understanding of threats to Black male leadership development, specifically in establishing a new paradigm for understanding the subtleties of bias, examining the relationship between RID status and leadership emergence, and the impact of multiple identity factors on leadership emergence.

New leadership teams can be added to what already exists, or current leadership teams can be refocused on these issues. Leadership teams should meet regularly and include diverse representation across areas of "professional expertise" (e.g., general education, bilingual education, and special education) and "cultural experience" (e.g., parents, community members, and others with rich relationships and knowledge of student backgrounds). Although most schools already have some form of student support or problem-solving teams in place, these teams are not always fully prepared--professionally and/or culturally--to address the needs of specific populations of students. This paper provides tips for a school leadership team that will effectively address the needs of English language learners (ELLs).

Research Methods: The research method used in this study was a quantitative comparative analysis. A purposeful sampling strategy was adopted based on geographical spread of the participants in Austria, Ireland and Turkey. The survey was also administered to all principals in four out of eighteen Norwegian counties. Descriptive analysis and nonparametric analysis were used. Findings: There is evidence to suggest that the foundations for culturally responsive assessment practices are beginning to take shape albeit varying degrees of difference in each country. However, the survey results also indicate the need for training and professional development, and this study also implies that not enough emphasis is being placed on culturally responsive assessment despite the rhetoric that espouses interculturalism. Implications for Research and Practice: The research points the need for upskilling in culturally responsive leadership as well as the development of an overarching culturally responsive assessment framework and toolkit that can be used by policy makers and schools to allay the various interpretations of what it means to satisfy the assessment needs of teachers and students with migrant backgrounds.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1204459; Acquisition Information: ANI Publishing Company.

Leadership capacity and efficacy are important indicators of success in higher education and are linked to important academic, career, and life benefits, such as career and leadership aspirations, work performance, the ability to cope and overcome stereotypes, and the adaptation to and persistence in the face of challenging situations. This quantitative study focuses on international students' confidence in their leadership abilities while studying in a foreign country and system in comparison with their domestic student peers.

With current mandates, greater accountability on school districts, states are feeling a sense of urgency to support successful learning outcomes for ELLs. The purpose of this study was to investigate leadership practices among principals in the New York City Department of Education public elementary schools. The researcher explored to what extent school leaders who serve a large number of ELLs (n > 20%) in a large urban school district promote advanced literacy skills to enhance instruction for ELLs. This research focused on the problem school leaders' face in addressing the increase of ELL population and 21st-century literacy demands rise in proficiency bar for what it means to be "literate". The study addressed the achievement gap between ELLs and their peers and examined the supports school leaders put in place to support teachers in advancing ELLs' language and literacy instruction. The first finding is the importance of providing multiple opportunities for students to interact with each other in rich tasks using all four modalities as a best instructional practice for ELLs. Another finding is the importance of accelerating or amplifying instruction rather than remediating learning as a best practice to enhance learning for ELLs. Several other findings include immersing students in culturally responsive learning environments to cultivate language and knowledge, ensuring equity for all learners and the importance for ELLs to be exposed to curricula that support 21st-century readiness. This research is intended to support leaders in understanding best strategies and/or protocols that school leaders can utilize to support advanced literacy instruction for ELLs to positively impact their achievement.

The purpose of this reflective essay is to capture how converting a doctoral educational leadership program from a quarter system to a semester system afforded two faculty members the opportunity to redesign their doctoral program into one that specifically focuses on social justice. We not only capture how the semester conversion process afforded us the opportunity to ensure the program was tied to preparing transformative school leaders, but highlight how it allowed us to implement programmatic supports predicated on ensuring that more students graduate. We believe the insights we gleaned from redesigning the Ed.D. program will assist other educational leadership faculty and directors. They will be able to graduate more leaders who are equipped to build socially-just schools and solve complex problems facing the communities they serve.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1233801; Acquisition Information: Southern Connecticut State University. 501 Crescent Street, New Haven, CT 06515. e-mail: 203-392-7278; Web site: https:/go.southernct.edu/jelps/; Language: English; Education Level: Higher EducationPostsecondary EducationElementary Secondary Education; Reference Count: -1; Journal Code: JAN2020; Level of Availability: Available online; Publication Type: Academic Journal; Publication Type: Report; Entry Date: 2019PB  - Journal of Educational Leadership and Policy StudiesJF  - Journal of Educational Leadership and Policy StudiesSN  - 2473-2826AV  - Southern Connecticut State University. 501 Crescent Street, New Haven, CT 06515. e-mail: 203-392-7278; Web site: https:/go.southernct.edu/jelps/UR  - http://proxy.library.tamu.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eric&AN=EJ1233801&site=ehost-liveM1  - Journal ArticleER  - TY  - THESID  - 256460A1  - Pounders, CheriseT1  - Social Justice Leadership: Advocating Equity, Access and Opportunity for Black Students Attending Urban High-Poverty Elementary SchoolsY1  - 2017Y2  - 01/01KW  - Elementary SchoolsKW  - PrincipalsKW  - Instructional LeadershipKW  - Social JusticeKW  - Elementary School StudentsKW  - African American StudentsKW  - AdvocacyKW  - Equal EducationKW  - Access to EducationKW  - Urban SchoolsKW  - PovertyKW  - Qualitative ResearchKW  - PhenomenologyKW  - Educational StrategiesKW  - BarriersKW  - Resilience (Psychology)KW  - Semi Structured InterviewsKW  - Reading SkillsKW  - Academic AchievementKW  - ExpectationKW  - Culturally Relevant EducationKW  - Faculty DevelopmentAB  - The purpose of this qualitative phenomenological study was to explore and describe the lived experiences and perspectives of 4 elementary school principals and 4 instructional leaders committed to social justice practices who have improved and sustained grade level performance in reading with Black students for the duration of 3 consecutive years. Four research questions guided this study and included: What strategies are used by elementary principals and instructional leaders to advance equity, access, and opportunity, to improve core teaching and curriculum, address barriers faced, and develop resilience when leading the work of social justice? Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with the intention of learning specific leadership strategies used to create, promote, and sustain equitable learning environments where Black students meet and exceed proficiency rates in reading. Key findings suggest that leaders who accomplish and sustain high academic achievement at their schools hold high expectations for their students, immerse themselves in culturally responsive professional development trainings, seek community supports to enhance curricular programs, and invest in professional study and self-care practices to sustain themselves both professionally and personally. Recommendations for future policy demonstrate the need for principal preparation programs dedicated to addressing social justice leadership practices as a means to advocate equity, access, and opportunity for marginalized and oppressed students everywhere.

These leaders merge cultural criticism with moral and political judgment, analyzing urban youths' lived experiences and representational practices as well as analyzing counter-narrative texts in Black popular culture that have implications for urban education. As new world "bricoleurs," these educational leaders use a multi-vocal, polyphonic approach in Black popular culture to disrupt a Western culture of homogeneity that is less culturally responsive to the dynamic struggles Black youth face in urban communities. In addition, as critical organic catalysts, they locate life-pressing public concerns within subcultural communities of resistance as relevant knowledge to organize a radical democratic politics in educational leadership.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1131044; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

The study examined the ratings produced by that system to determine the system's reliability, schools' progress in implementing RTI, and whether ratings were related to school characteristics. Two years after rolling out RTI, 53Â percent of participating schools were implementing it with adequate fidelity. Average implementation ratings suggest that priority schools need more coaching and professional development on RTI than do focus schools and other schools and that most schools could benefit from coaching and professional development on tier 3 instruction and instruction for diverse students. Implementation fidelity ratings were related to the percentage of teachers with advanced credentials, retention of licensed staff, percentage of economically disadvantaged students, and percentage of students suspended during the school year.

Yet research on the effects of tiered interventions in school settings is thin. Most studies that show strong impacts have focused on small samples of schools where the leaders of small group instruction (tier 2 instructors) were employed by the intervention developers, thereby allowing the developers to pay close attention to the quality of implementation and to give direct guidance on tier 2 instruction. Studies of these same interventions that involve more schools and that use school staff to lead the small group instruction often find smaller effects. Several factors may explain why the larger studies produce smaller effects; one such factor may be that little effort was made by the schools to monitor implementation systematically and use implementation information as the basis for improvements\. Prior to this study Regional Educational Laboratory Midwest and partners affiliated with the former National Center on Response to Intervention worked with Milwaukee Public Schools to develop a research-based rubric for rating school-level implementation of RTI. The rubric was coupled with a data dashboard that analyzes ratings, displays results at various levels of aggregation, and identifies RTI components that are being implemented inadequately and require improvement. National Center on Response to Intervention staff successfully trained 22 of the district's school improvement coaches to use the rubric when rating implementation during school visits and to enter the ratings into the data dashboard. The current study analyzed ratings by district staff employed as school improvement coaches and who volunteered for the study. In 2014/15 these school improvement coaches visited 70 district schools that serve students in grades K-5. The coaches examined documents and interviewed school staff on implementation of RTI. Based on the information they gathered during a school visit, the coaches rated the schools' implementation of RTI using a 33-item rubric. Ratings for two schools were incomplete, leaving 68 schools in the sample. Analyses focused on the reliability of the RTI implementation rubric, average implementation ratings across the 68 schools, and correlations between aggregate ratings and school characteristics. Key findings include the following: (1) Ratings of the same schools made independently by two school improvement coaches employed by the district showed a high degree of consistency, even after accounting for chance (Cohen's kappa interrater reliability estimates range from 0.71 to 0.85 for the various components); (2) Ratings across the 33 indicators in the implementation fidelity rubric showed a high degree of consistency (alpha = 0.94), and the consistency of ratings on indicators for the six key RTI components fell in the adequate or good range (alphas for key components ranging from 0.70 to 0.85); (3) Two years after rolling out RTI, all 68 schools had made progress toward implementing the framework, and 53Â percent of schools were found to be implementing it with fidelity; (4) Some 69Â percent of schools had yet to implement the multitiered instruction component with adequate fidelity (especially the tier 3 subcomponent), and 49Â percent had yet to implement the evaluation component with adequate fidelity. These components were subsequently identified as priority areas for additional school-level professional development and coaching within the district; and (5) Several school characteristics showed statistically significant relationships with implementation ratings for RTI components. Specifically, higher-performing schools and schools with higher percentages of teachers with advanced credentials, higher staff retention rates, smaller percentages of economically disadvantaged students, and lower student suspension rates showed stronger implementation of RTI than did schools without these characteristics. The following are appended: (1) The district's implementation fidelity monitoringÂ system for the Response to Intervention framework; and (2) Data collection and methodology.

In the past, this work had often been relegated to the institutional fringes of higher education, its practitioners marginalized, and the work often portrayed as service, not scholarly. Today, higher education community engagement is a dynamic and continually evolving field of scholarship and practice that carries ever-increasing academic respect. This book contributes to the ever-under-construction edifice by presenting a scaffolding of the scholarship that has been part of the building process, documenting and analyzing the past, speculating about the future, and framing a continuing conversation about and for the field. The three parts of this book are designed to promote a continuing field-building conversation: a look back at foundational documents of the field; a set of provocative questions interrogating those foundational works; and a look to the future by the next generation of leaders in the field. The central part is the special 20th anniversary issue of the "Journal of Higher Education Outreach and Engagement," which brings together key documents of the scholarship of engagement with reflections on those documents by key scholars and/or the authors of the original works. In addition to highlighting the foundations and evolution of the field, this work also looks ahead to the next generation of voices and views as input to the conversation, with a closing chapter that includes invited essays by nine outstanding community-engaged thinkers and writers of the next 20 years who share their ideas about probable futures.

Working with over sixty principals across six regional clusters throughout Aotearoa New Zealand, these researchers utilised critical Kaupapa Maori methodology to observe, engage, and support MSI's vision of A Change in the Hearts and Minds of Principals in mainstream contexts. Qualitative data collected from leadership surveys, hui reflective statements, and other documents were analysed to validate and strengthen MSI's efforts to establish a critical mass of effective school leadership practices that promote and sustain Maori success as Maori. This paper highlights the research and outcomes resulting from evaluating the personal and professional growth of MSI leaders.

This inquiry builds on multicultural education and educational leadership to explore an alternative approach to mainstream leadership practice. Purpose: To examine ways in which educational leaders of color in K-12 schools and higher education settings, tap into positive attributes of their identities to address issues germane to social justice and educational equity. Data Collection and Analysis: Qualitative data were examined to determine connections among participants with regard to literature reviewed and research questions. Analyses checked for evidence of culturally responsive leadership practice and the use of critical race theory. Findings: Nine common leadership characteristics were identified. Any leader can choose to use a critical race theory lens when practicing leadership for social justice and equity in diverse settings. Conclusions: These findings suggest the need for alternative models of leadership as a response to diversity in schools and universities, and value in exploring connections between multicultural education and educational leadership.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1030979; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

The book describes an innovative network of twenty preK-8 schools located across the United States striving to address the barriers to inclusive education. Based on an ongoing initiative begun in 2012 by a team at Boston College, the book shows how these schools transformed to better serve their diverse, multilingual communities by adopting a two-way immersion model with the help of local faculty and other experts in bilingual education serving as mentors. "Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Education" describes the founding of the network, the theory of action that drove its design, and the compelling evidence linking the networked approach to subsequent growth in student achievement and enrollment at the schools. Chapters written by the network's mentors examine in detail six practices that were key to driving the schools' transformation, including critical conversations, fidelity assurances to the two-way immersion model, coordinated professional development, teacher reflection cycles, family engagement, and distributive leadership. The editors draw key lessons from this network for other leaders and argue for increased attention to culturally and linguistically responsive schooling that builds on students' sociocultural competence, cultivates an appreciation and proficiency in multiple languages, and promotes high levels of academic achievement. This book contains the following chapters: (1) Embracing the New Mainstream Through Culturally and Linguistically Responsive Schooling (Martin Scanlan, Cristina Hunter, and Elizabeth R. Howard); (2) A Theory of Action (Martin Scanlan, Kristin Barstow Melley, Cristina Hunter, and Elizabeth R.

A vision is offered of systemic cultural responsiveness and culturally relevant teaching practices that nurture and engage all learners. The role of the school counselor in realizing such transformation is described. In this vision, the tenets of advocacy, consultation, collaboration, systemic change, and leadership identified in the ASCA National Model are recognized as the means by which the school counselor can indirectly promote student achievement. This article offers examples of intervention strategies designed to impact the school system, the teaching and learning process, and foster cultural responsiveness.

However, the spaces developed for historically marginalized faculty (HMF) are still limited and not focused enough. This study examined tailored programs and perspectives amongst faculty developers regarding the advancement or furthering minoritization of historically marginalized faculty via institutional based and national programs. Findings include best practices in HMF tailored programs, curriculum topics for faculty developer preparedness, and address an "all faculty matter" perspective.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1229732; Acquisition Information: New Forums Press, Inc.

However, curricular policies can also serve to enhance social reconstructionist and social justice education. In this article, we describe two case studies focused on a state-level policy--Montana's Indian Education for All--aimed at advancing understandings about Indigenous experiences and worldviews. The first study's findings demonstrate Indian Education for All's potential to support practicing teachers, including teachers with limited experience working with Indigenous communities, in their efforts to confront settler-colonialism and neoliberalism within curricula. The results from our second study suggest the potential for Indian Education for All to create space for Indigenous student leadership. However, our research also provides cautionary notes about the potential for "tools," such as Indian Education for All, to unintentionally reinforce settler-colonialism, neoliberalism, and racism, as they can create opportunities for racial microaggressions and inequitable expectations. We conclude with recommendations for teacher education programs, institutional leaders, and policymakers.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1190504; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

The purpose of this research was to examine the relationship between the MSA Pre-service candidates' social capital and their propensity to become culturally responsive leaders. The 23 participants in this study were pre-service Master of School Administration students. A cross-sectional design with the regression analysis procedure is useful in determining the predictor's variables for the influence of multiculturalism and student experiences. Summaries of correlations, means, and standard deviations were reported, along with "F"-ratio, "R"-square, and confidence intervals for resulting predictors. Educational leadership programs need to redefine their roles in terms of how they are preparing twenty-first century leaders for twenty-first century schools. Now, more than ever, there is an increasing phenomenon of poor educational outcomes for students despite the efforts of educational leaders. This study explores the theoretical construct of culturally responsive leadership and social capital as a framework for educational leaders to follow in order to close the opportunity gap for students. More specifically, the study explored the social capital of pre-service Master of School Administrations students and their propensity toward becoming culturally responsive leaders. The study revealed that a correlation could be made between a student's social capital index and their propensity toward becoming culturally responsive leaders.

The article integrates scholarship in ethical leadership (EL) and social justice leadership (SJL). The resultant conceptualised model is an expanded version of a preliminary model included in a research brief of an empirical study. The Ethical Leadership Praxis in a Global Society model includes four interactive dimensions: (1) understanding social justice theory and leadership theory, (2) applying state, national and professional ethical/legal standards, (3) engaging in ethical leadership practice and role modelling for culturally responsive leadership (CRL), and (4) employing personal leadership ethics and core values as a cyclical process of self-reflection and decision-making. This article makes an original contribution for building leadership praxis centred on ethical leadership. The model applies ethical and social justice leadership theory and encourages leaders to self-reflect on their own values, practices of leadership and how their actions can create inclusivity. Empirical studies testing the model is recommended in a variety of international educational settings.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1193567; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

The danger with such an approach is the lack of specificity. Yet, specificity can set the boundaries so narrow that one is led to believe one approach is better than another or that "one size fits all situations." The author suggests that what educators and educational leadership programs need is some balance between the "broad" and "narrow" views of leadership in order to foster congruence between individual values and beliefs and organizational missions, visions, and activities. He focuses on how being an American Indian/Alaska Native influences leadership, especially educational leadership. He addresses the relationship between cultural identity and professional reputation. Because cultural beliefs, values, and actions vary, one can be seen as an effective leader with the ability to achieve results or be known as less effective or even incompetent. He suggests that one needs to take a critical reflective view of one's cultural identity and its inherent leadership values.

Community partners representing four organizations came together with this common goal. There are a growing number of Micronesian families living abroad, specifically in Hawai'i. Micronesian students and families have expressed an on-going dissatisfaction regarding their negative experiences at school and work. In the last twenty years, Hawai'i has seen an exponential increase in the number of migrants from Compact of Free Association (COFA) countries: the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Republic of the Marshall Islands (RMI), and the Republic of Palau. These students have suffered low graduation rates, high behavior referrals, and insufficient academic progress. While the Hawai'i Department of Education (DOE) has tried a number of strategies, including hiring bilingual part-time teachers to help English Language Learners (ELL), the strategies have not led to widespread student success. These small island countries share many cultural values, but are also quite diverse. The unique opportunity that this consultancy project presented was that there were four different clients that on three islands. The Hawai'i-based non-profit organizations--Faith Action for Community Equity (FACE), Micronesian United-Big Island (MU-BI), The Learning Coalition (TLC), We Are Oceania (WAO)--commissioned the feasibility study for the establishment of a Micronesian culture-based charter school or other educational program. Though each organization has their own mission and vision, their interest to better serve the Micronesian community at large was the same. From the onset of the project, the consultancy group chose to conduct qualitative research to better understand the needs of the Micronesian community. Both existing and new data were analyzed for this qualitative study. Consultancy project data from final reports and program evaluation questionnaires completed by both previous and current students, mentors, advisors, and community partners were collected. New questionnaires were completed by current students from three identified consultancy groups who expressed interest in contributing to the research and evaluation process. The practices of the consultancy projects occurred in the present, but are part of a complex living system that draws from the present and past as it looks to the future. There is a complex landscape in Hawai'i's educational system that continues to struggle for effective ways to support educational self-determination for Native Hawaiians as well as provide culturally responsive and equal access to education for all of Hawai'i's children. The authors assert that the consultancy project framework of the EdD program resulted in an ecological space of interrelated learning communities where groups of learners, comprising doctoral students and clients, collaborated in an organic practice that generated new experiences that provoked old mindsets and engaged in learning that enhanced one of the principles of the Hawai'i EdD program: social justice leadership practice.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1170255; Acquisition Information: College of Education, University of Hawaii at Manoa.

This program was developed through community-based participatory research in a First Nations Community in northern Ontario: Wiikwemkoong Unceded Territory. It is a 9- or 10-day intensive program involving a wilderness canoe expedition homeward through the traditional territory of Wiikwemkoong. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the OALE on youth well-being, using a culturally appropriate measure of health: The Aboriginal Children's Health and Well-being Measure (ACHWMÂ©). A pre- and post-intervention study design was used to assess the impact of the OALE on health and well-being. Twenty-eight participants completed both the ACHWM and the Global Health Rating (GHR) instruments before and after the OALE intervention. In total, 68% of participants reported higher ACHWM scores after the OALE (Delta] = 3.9, p = 0.014). There were improvements in the Medicine Wheel quadrants score of the ACHWM (spiritual, emotional, physical, and mental). Although 25% of participants had higher scores on the GHR, this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.55). However, this study highlights the value of evaluating local programming in a culturally-relevant way. Using the ACHWM, it was demonstrated that there was a significant change in the well-being of the OALE youth participants; this was something that the GHR was unable to capture. Thus, the ACHWM appears to be sensitive to short-term changes in health. More research is needed to confirm the specificity and sensitivity of the ACHWM in different populations and contexts.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1235674; Acquisition Information: Springer.

It is raising concerns regarding the pace of systemic reform and sector wide professional renewal. Culturally responsive schooling practices may be helpful at this time because it locates the experiences of learners as powerfully influencing engagement and achievement. This article reports on "The culturally responsive schooling project," a study focused on postgraduate students as they prepared for, undertook, and reflected on practicum experiences. Participants identified three barriers that impacted on their culturally responsive efforts: mentors encouraging limited and limiting curricula, pedagogic and assessment practices; mentors communicating resistance to doing things differently or valuing cultural responsiveness; and a fearful awareness of being evaluated by their mentors. The ambition of this discussion then is to encourage a rethink of the interconnections between teacher education, school leadership, and inservice professional development.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1158828; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

As the Latina/o population increases in the United States, we must prepare teachers and school administrators to provide opportunities for an equal education for minority students of all races, cultural backgrounds, or ethnicities. School leadership plays an important role in the effectiveness of educational access for minority students. Leaders must review and modify their practices to ensure that minority students have the opportunity to be productive citizens in our society. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the characteristics of effective high school Leaders of Color and White leaders for Latina/o students in secondary schools and to provide recommendations for further investigation. This study revealed findings related to culturally responsive school leadership for Latina/o student success, with leaders of Color and White allies reporting different perspectives on equity leadership.

Research Methods: The reviewed literature includes 69 neuroscience studies and 4 books on neuroscience. The brain activities and neurotransmitters associated with the constructs pertinent to educational leadership were coded to bridge the knowledge base of neuroscience and educational leadership. Findings: The neural mechanisms of the constructs related to educational leadership (e.g., vision, charisma, trust, and organizational justice) were organized by four different leadership approaches: charismatic, transformational, destructive, and culturally responsive school leadership. Emotions are the common thread weaving through all four leadership approaches. Implications: This study has salient theoretical, methodological, and practical implications for educational leadership. Theoretically, the findings not only accentuate the role of emotions in educational leadership, but also reveal the trade-off between emotions and analytical calculation in leaders' decision making. Methodologically, the neuroscience methods (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging, quantitative electroencephalography, and hormonal analysis) add to the methodological repertoire of educational leadership research. Practically, the findings warrant the emotion training and present the potential of using neurological measurements in school leadership preparation and professional development.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1207332; Acquisition Information: SAGE Publications. 2455 Teller Road, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320.

The results highlight that, while in the majority of these systems measures aimed in this direction have been implemented, school leadership policies are still at an early stage, with several problems, contradictions, and lack of internal and external coherence. The article ends with a discussion about the tensions embedded on the translation of the Anglo-Saxon discourse of school leadership to the particular context of Latin America and suggests the need to rethink a regional local-response to the goal of promoting principal leadership.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1102170; Acquisition Information: Routledge.

To understand how educational leaders can best serve this changing student population, we used Critical Bilingual leadership, "Liderazgo," to interrogate the aim to create a culturally and linguistically responsive school. We found that "Liderazgo" was operationalized across the following themes: promoting dual language programming as the foundation for equity; drawing on experiential knowledge as a strength; fostering relationships through transcaring; and exercising instructional bilingual leadership.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1104945; Acquisition Information: International Journal of Multicultural Education.

School counselors are leaders who facilitate comprehensive school counseling programs and demonstrate their relevance to school initiatives and centrality to the school's mission. The purpose of this article is to discuss both a multi-tiered system of supports and comprehensive school counseling programs, demonstrating the overlap between the two frameworks. Specific similarities include: leadership team and collaboration, coordinated services, school counselor roles, data collection, evidence-based practices, equity, cultural responsiveness, advocacy, prevention, positive school climate, and systemic change. A case study is included to illustrate a school counseling department integrating a multi-tiered system of supports with their comprehensive school counseling program. In the case study, school counselors are described as interveners, facilitators and supporters regarding the implementation of a multi-tiered system of supports.N1  - Accession Number: EJ1115900; Acquisition Information: National Board for Certified Counselors, Inc. and Affiliates. 3 Terrace Way, Greensboro, NC 27403.
