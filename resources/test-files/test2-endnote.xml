In this study, we investigate the marketing tactics being used on marijuana dispensary websites in the USA that could influence substance use behaviors. One hundred dispensary websites were randomly selected from 10 states that allowed the legal use of medical or recreational marijuana and had at least 10 operational dispensaries. Three dispensaries were excluded due to non-functioning websites, leaving a sample of 97 dispensaries. Content analysis was conducted on these dispensaries' websites, with the primary areas of focus including website age verification, marijuana effects, warnings, and promotional tactics. Among the 97 dispensaries, 75% did not include age verification. Roughly 30% offered online ordering and 21% offered delivery services. Sixty-seven percent made health claims pertaining to medical conditions that could be treated by their marijuana products, with moderate or conclusive evidence to support their claims. Less than half of the dispensaries (45%) advised consumers of possible side effects, and only 18% included warnings about contraindications. Nearly half (44%) offered reduced prices or coupons, 19% offered &quot;buy one get one free&quot; offers, and 16% provided giveaways or free samples. Our findings indicate that marijuana dispensary websites are easily accessible to youth. In addition, only a small amount of the websites advised consumers about possible side effects or contraindications. This study suggests the need for surveillance of marijuana commercialization and online advertising especially in the context of state policy reforms.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Jessica</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ethical Issues Arising from Marijuana Use by Nursing Mothers in a Changing Legal and Cultural Context.</title><secondary-title>HEC forum : an interdisciplinary journal on hospitals' ethical and legal issues</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HEC forum : an interdisciplinary journal on hospitals' ethical and legal issues</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>Netherlands</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10730-018-9368-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30511088</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the early 2000s, several states legalized marijuana for medicinal uses. Since then, more and more states have either decriminalized or legalized marijuana use for medical or recreational purposes. Federal law has remained unchanged. The state-level decriminalization of marijuana and the concomitant de-stigmatizing and mainstreaming is likely to lead to greater use among the general population, including among nursing mothers. Marijuana is already one of the most widely used illicit substances among lactating women. There exist few studies demonstrating the effects of marijuana in breast milk on nursing babies. In the present context of a changing legal landscape, shifting cultural beliefs, and the absence of clear professional guidelines, healthcare professionals are faced with ethical questions around how best to support nursing mothers and their babies when marijuana use is a factor. This paper first presents an overview of the law, science, and professional guidelines as they relate to marijuana and breastfeeding. Then, I offer an assessment of the relevant ethical issues providers and their patients may need to navigate.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jutras-Aswad, Didier</author><author>Le Foll, Bernard</author><author>Bruneau, Julie</author><author>Wild, T Cameron</author><author>Wood, Evan</author><author>Fischer, Benedikt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thinking Beyond Legalization: The Case for Expanding Evidence-Based Options for Cannabis Use Disorder Treatment in Canada.</title><secondary-title>Canadian journal of psychiatry.

This evolving regulatory landscape underscores the importance of understanding the attitudinal/perceptual pathways from marijuana policy to marijuana use behavior, especially for adolescents and young adults. Our study uses the restricted-access National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) 2004-2012 data and a difference-in-differences design to compare the pre-policy, post-policy changes in marijuana-related attitude/perception between adolescents and young adults from ten states that implemented medical marijuana laws during the study period and those from the remaining states. We examined four attitudinal/perception pathways that may play a role in adolescent and young adult marijuana use behavior, including (1) perceived availability of marijuana, (2) perceived acceptance of marijuana use, (3) perceived wrongfulness of recreational marijuana use, and (4) perceived harmfulness of marijuana use. We found that state implementation of medical marijuana laws between 2004 and 2012 was associated with a 4.72% point increase (95% CI 0.15, 9.28) in the probability that young adults perceived no/low health risk related to marijuana use. Medical marijuana law implementation is also associated with a 0.37% point decrease (95% CI -0.72, -0.03) in the probability that adolescents perceived parental acceptance of marijuana use. As more states permit medical marijuana use, marijuana-related attitude/perception need to be closely monitored, especially perceived harmfulness. The physical and psychological effects of marijuana use should be carefully investigated and clearly conveyed to the public.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Budney, Alan J</author><author>Sofis, Michael J</author><author>Borodovsky, Jacob T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An update on cannabis use disorder with comment on the impact of policy related to therapeutic and recreational cannabis use.</title><secondary-title>European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European archives of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>Germany</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00406-018-0976-1</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30604051</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Confusion and controversy related to the potential for cannabis use to cause harm, or alternatively to provide benefit, continues globally. This issue has grown in intensity and importance with the increased recognition of the public health implications related to the escalation of the legalization of cannabis and cannabinoid products. This selective overview and commentary attempt to succinctly convey what is known about one potential consequence of cannabis use, the development of cannabis use disorder (CUD). Such knowledge may help guide a reasonable and objective public health perspective on the potential impact of cannabis use and CUD. Current scientific data and clinical observation strongly support the contention that cannabis use, like the use of other substances such as alcohol, opioids, stimulants, and tobacco, can develop into a use disorder (addiction) with important clinical consequences. Epidemiological data indicate that the majority of those who use cannabis do not have problems related to their use, but a substantial subset (10-30%) do report experiencing symptoms and consequences consistent with a CUD. Treatment seeking for CUD comprises a substantial proportion of all substance use treatment admissions, yet treatment response rates show much room for improvement. Changing cannabis policies related to its therapeutic and recreational use are likely to impact the development of CUD and its course; however, definitive data on such effects are not yet available. Clearly, the development of more effective prevention and treatment strategies is needed for those vulnerable to developing a CUD and for those with a CUD.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sexton, Michelle</author><author>Cuttler, Carrie</author><author>Mischley, Laurie K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Survey of Cannabis Acute Effects and Withdrawal Symptoms: Differential Responses Across User Types and Age.</title><secondary-title>Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of alternative and complementary medicine (New York, N.Y.)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/acm.2018.0319</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30383388</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OBJECTIVES: There is a rapidly evolving legal and medical culture around cannabis, with corresponding changes in the demographics of users. For instance, the percentage of the aging population accessing cannabis is growing substantially, outpacing other age groups. The goals of this study were to describe the acute effects of cannabis, subjective experiences of withdrawal, and beliefs around the addictiveness of cannabis, as well as to determine whether these effects differ as a function of age or reason for use (medical vs. recreational use). It was hypothesized that medical users and younger users would report fewer adverse effects., SUBJECTS: Survey responses from 2905 cannabis users were analyzed., RESULTS: Hierarchical logistic regression analyses were used to compare group percentages after statistically controlling for confounding differences in their demographic and cannabis use characteristics. The most commonly endorsed acute effects were improved sleep, more calm/peaceful, desire to eat, more creative, and dry mouth; while the most commonly endorsed withdrawal symptoms were irritability, insomnia, and anxiety. Relative to recreational users, medical users were less likely to report undesirable acute effects but were more likely to report undesirable withdrawal symptoms. Older (50+) individuals reported fewer undesirable acute effects and withdrawal symptoms compared with younger users (18-29). Only 17% of the total sample reported believing that cannabis is addictive, and this did not vary as a function of reason for use., CONCLUSIONS: Older people and medical users appear to experience acute and withdrawal effects of cannabis differently than recreational and younger users, perhaps because these groups benefit more from the medicinal properties of cannabis. These data can provide descriptive information to help inform health care providers and potential consumers about effects of cannabis use.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mahamad, Syed</author><author>Hammond, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retail price and availability of illicit cannabis in Canada.</title><secondary-title>Addictive behaviors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Addictive behaviors</full-title></periodical><pages>402-408</pages><volume>90</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.12.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30530299</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>INTRODUCTION: This study sought to estimate the number of illicit retailers and the average price of cannabis in the largest municipality in each province and territory in Canada by obtaining information from retailers., METHODS: Online search engines were used to identify retailers in each municipality. The advertised prices for various volumes of the least expensive, most expensive, and most popular dry herb were determined using the retailer's website, Weedmaps, or Leafly. Data was collected between October 2017 and May 2018, including two waves in Toronto to examine changes over a five-month period., RESULTS: Across the 13 municipalities, 997 cannabis retailers were identified, including 215 physical storefronts. The average price per gram of cannabis was $10.02, $7.80, and $12.30 for the most popular, least expensive, and most expensive strains, respectively. The price-per-gram decreased as purchase volume increased: purchasing one-eighth of an ounce and one ounce of cannabis led to savings of up to 9% and 27%, respectively. Prices were consistent across municipalities, although the number of outlets varied greatly. Prices were similar between storefronts and delivery-only services; however, delivery services offered larger discounts for cannabis purchased by the ounce. The five-month comparison in Toronto revealed modest changes in the number of retailers and more pronounced changes in the price of the most popular and least expensive strains., CONCLUSION: The findings depict a well-established retail cannabis market in Canada in the year prior to legalization. The average advertised price of the most popular cannabis varieties was approximately $10, which aligns with the projected retail price of cannabis from licensed sources following legalization in Canada.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

This research is the first to explore the geographic associations between these three legal drug outlets with surrounding crime and violence in a large low-income urban community of color. First, spatial buffer analyses were performed using point-location and publically accessible January-December 2014 crime data to examine the geography of all felony property and violent crimes occurring within 100, 200, 500, and 1000-foot buffers of these three legal drug outlet types across South Los Angeles. Next, spatial regression analyses explored the geographic associations between density of these outlets and property and violent crimes at the census tract level. Results indicated that mean property and violent crime rates within 100-foot buffers of tobacco shops and alcohol outlets-but not MMDs-substantially exceeded community-wide mean crime rates and rates around grocery/convenience stores (i.e., comparison properties licensed to sell both alcohol and tobacco). Spatial regression analyses confirmed that tobacco shops significantly positively associated with property and violent crimes after controlling for key neighborhood factors (poverty, renters, resident mobility, ethnic/racial heterogeneity). Thus, study findings provide the first empirical evidence that tobacco shops may constitute public health threats that associate with crime and violence in U.S. low-income urban communities of color. Implementing and enforcing control policies that regulate and monitor tobacco shops in these communities may promote community health by improving public safety.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to determine whether this was associated with a change in Emergency Department (ED) presentations with acute NPS toxicity., METHOD: ED presentations to our inner-city hospital in London, UK, with acute NPS toxicity in the 12 months before and after the PSA introduction [June 2015-May 2016 (2015/2016) and June 2016-May 2017 (2016/2017)] were obtained from our database. The following data were extracted: (i) demographics; (ii) NPS(s) self-reported [categorized as synthetic cannabinoids (SC), cathinones, and &quot;other NPS&quot;)]; and (iii) month of presentation., RESULTS: There were 1884 presentations with recreational drug toxicity, 447 (23.7%) involved NPS. There was no difference in the overall proportion of presentations involving an NPS in 2015/2016 [n = 196 (22.3%)] and 2016/2017 [251 (24.9%); (p = .48)]. There were a mean +/- SD of 16.3 +/- 3.7 NPS-related presentations per month in 2015/2016 and 20.9 +/- 9.2 in 2016/2017; there was no significant change in overall monthly NPS-related presentations between these periods (p = .15). However, mean +/- SD monthly SC-related presentations increased from 2015/2016 (5.9 +/- 2.5) to 2016/2017 (17 +/- 9.8); p = .004. Mean monthly cathinone-related presentations decreased from 2015/2016 (8.8 +/- 4.2) to 2016/2017 (3.8 +/- 2.7); p = .001. There was no significant change in monthly mean &quot;other NPS&quot; presentations from 2015/2016 (1.8 +/- 2.2) to 2016/2017 (0.5 +/- 0.8); p = .062. Between 2015/2016 and 2016/2017, SCs as a proportion of NPS-related presentations increased (r = .90) whilst cathinones decreased (r = -0.82)., CONCLUSION: NPS present front-line health services with unique challenges, and the PSA 2016 represents a major legislative effort in UK to limit their availability and supply. The burden of NPS use on this inner-city ED remains large 12 months after this legislation has come into force, with evolving patterns of NPS use.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Bankole A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comment on 'Health aspects of cannabis: revisited' (Hollister).</title><secondary-title>The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The international journal of neuropsychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>81-82</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>1998</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=11281948</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Dr. Leo Hollister's excellent article begins to address the need for better understanding of the effects of cannabis use on health. The last five years in the US have seen an increase in advocacy groups extolling the medicinal utility of cannabis. On 5 November 1996, this culminated in California (proposition 215) joining the list of states permitting the limited use of cannabis for the medicinal treatment of disorders including intractable pain, glaucoma, nausea induced by chemotherapy for cancer or by AZT or Foscavir for the treatment of AIDS, and for spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis (Burstein, 1997; West and Homi, 1996; Grinspoon and Bakalar, 1995; Nahas and Manger, 1995). Of these potential uses for cannabis, the evidence for the treatment of nausea and the stimulation of appetite in cachetic patients appears most promising (for a review see Voth and Schwartz, 1997). Yet not only do doubts remain about the effectiveness of cannabis for the treatment of these conditions, since definitive controlled clinical studies are typically lacking (Voelker, 1997), but there is concern that any therapeutic advantage is more than offset by its harmful effects. Within this context of increased medical sanction for the use of cannabis in specific disease states for which it may have therapeutic potential, evaluating its risks vs. benefits profile is essential to rational prescribing. In addition, evaluating the public health risks associated with reports of increased risks of cannabis use (Robertson et al., Poulton et al., 1997), is of concern to advocates of its widespread legalization, governmental agencies attempting to limit its promulgation, and to planners and providers of health care charged with providing treatment for its consequences.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mayoral-van Son, Jacqueline</author><author>Juncal-Ruiz, Maria</author><author>Ortiz-Garcia de la Foz, Victor</author><author>Cantarero-Prieto, David</author><author>Blazquez-Fernandez, Carla</author><author>Paz-Zulueta, Maria</author><author>Paras-Bravo, Paula</author><author>Ayuso-Mateos, Jose L</author><author>Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Understanding the direct and indirect costs of a first episode of psychosis program: Insights from PAFIP of Cantabria, Spain, during the first year of intervention.</title><secondary-title>Early intervention in psychiatry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Early intervention in psychiatry</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>Australia</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/eip.12752</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30311416</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>AIM: Early intervention psychiatric services for patients with psychosis aim to limit the most damaging outcomes and reduce the patient's risk of social drift, decreasing illness severity and thus containing healthcare costs. There is a scarcity of studies that focus on first-episode psychosis (FEP), and those few that have been published only looked at direct health costs, but not at indirect costs, which make up the bulk of the budget. Our study aims to explore the short-term (1-year follow-up) economic cost of a FEP Program, including both direct and indirect costs., METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from the clinical records of 157 patients included in the Programa Atencion Fases Iniciales de Psicosis, from Marques de Valdecilla University Hospital, Santander. Our data collection sheet collated data from direct and indirect costs associated with the illness. Data were also extracted from the Cantabria Health Service Records. STATA 15.0 was used for statistical analysis., RESULTS: On average, the total costs during the first year were 48 353.51 per patient, with direct healthcare costs being 13 729.47 (28.39%), direct non-medical costs 108.6 (0.22%), and indirect costs 34 515.44 (71.39%). We found that hospitalization costs were higher in males (p = 0.081) and in cannabis users (p = 0.032). The number of relapses increased both, hospitalization and treatment costs (r = 0.40 p = 0.000; r = 0.24 p = 0.067, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Intensive Early Intervention in Psychosis Services may result in cost savings by decreasing hospitalization, premature mortality, disability, unemployment, and legal problems; however, the first year after diagnosis would represent the one with the highest costs.Copyright © 2018 John Wiley &amp; Sons Australia, Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Belackova, Vendula</author><author>Wilkins, Chris</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Consumer agency in cannabis supply - Exploring auto-regulatory documents of the cannabis social clubs in Spain.</title><secondary-title>The International journal on drug policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The International journal on drug policy</full-title></periodical><pages>26-34</pages><volume>54</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>Netherlands</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2017.12.018</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29367012</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: There is growing experience with the not-for-profit, consumer-driven cannabis social club (CSC) model that builds on self-supply, self-organization and harm-reduction; these are principles upon which people who use drugs (PWUD) have been engaging for decades. Recent legalization of cannabis in a number of jurisdictions and the related challenges in regulating production, sale, taxation and health-related matters have raised interest in non-commercial models of cannabis supply. The &quot;codes of conduct&quot; (CsoC) of CSC federations in Spain might reveal whether a consumer-based model could overcome these challenges., METHODS: To examine the content of the CSC auto-regulatory documents, an online search using key terms to identify the CsoC was conducted. Six documents were found; analysis of the main thematic categories and overarching themes was conducted. It was discussed how these corresponded to the areas of cannabis policy regulation and what the main limitations of the CSC model were., RESULTS: The CsoC detailed the rules for CSC administration, not-for-profit aims, &quot;invitation only&quot; and other conditions of membership, collective cultivation and security as well as for operation of the consumption venue and health-related initiatives. The themes in the CsoC overlapped with cannabis regulatory areas as outlined internationally. Concern over cannabis prices and potency was missing in the CsoC. The potential strengths of the CSC model might include safe environment for peer-delivered harm reduction practice, preventing illicit transactions, quality control, shifting economic surplus to the consumers and increased consumer responsibility. The limitations of the CSC model include high threshold, disguised motives, tax revenue and the risk of both under- and over-regulation., CONCLUSION: CSCs represent an opportunity to enhance consumer agency and responsibility. The right &quot;to be self-supplied&quot; with psychoactive substances can be granted to consumer associations - but authorities need to provide a framework to facilitate this voluntary self-organization, including minimum standards around public health and safety, and to involve consumers in the development of these regulations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Marijuana cultivation can have significant negative collateral effects on the environment that are often unknown or overlooked. Focusing on the state of California, where by some estimates 60%-70% of the marijuana consumed in the United States is grown, we argue that (a) the environmental harm caused by marijuana cultivation merits a direct policy response, (b) current approaches to governing the environmental effects are inadequate, andCopyright (c) neglecting discussion of the environmental impacts of cultivation when shaping future marijuana use and possession policies represents a missed opportunity to reduce, regulate, and mitigate environmental harm.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wadsworth, E</author><author>Hammond, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>International differences in patterns of cannabis use among youth: Prevalence, perceptions of harm, and driving under the influence in Canada, England &amp; United States.</title><secondary-title>Addictive behaviors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Addictive behaviors</full-title></periodical><pages>171-175</pages><volume>90</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.10.050</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30412908</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Cannabis is the most widely used illicit substance in the world. An increasing number of jurisdictions have legalized medical and non-medical cannabis; comparisons across jurisdictions can help evaluate the impact of these policy innovations. The current study examined patterns of cannabis use among youth in Canada (CA), England (EN) and the United States (US). At the time of study, non-medical cannabis use was prohibited federally in all three countries; however, medical cannabis was accessible with varying restrictions in CA, EN and most US states, while non-medical cannabis was legal in four US states., METHODS: Data come from an international online survey conducted in July 2017 (n=12,064). Youth, aged 16-19, were asked about cannabis consumption, perceived access to cannabis, perceptions of harm, and driving after cannabis use. All estimates represent weighted data., RESULTS: US youth were more likely to report more frequent cannabis consumption, easier access, lower perceptions of harm, and higher rates of driving after cannabis use than CA and EN youth. CA youth reported more frequent consumption, easier access, and higher rates of driving after cannabis use than EN youth., CONCLUSION: CA and US youth had higher prevalence of use, easier access, lower perceived harm and higher driving rates after cannabis use in comparison to EN. These differences may reflect more permissive cannabis policies in CA and US, as well as pre-existing trends. Future waves of the international cannabis study will examine trends over time within the same countries after cannabis legalization in CA and additional US states.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to assess college students' perceptions of health communication messages comparing primary and secondary prevention messages concerning marijuana., PARTICIPANTS: Participants (n = 487) included college students, ages 18-25, enrolled in a Midwestern University., METHODS: Participants assessed messages based on likeability, creativity, believability, persuasiveness, relevance, and usefulness using an online questionnaire that also included open-end comments., RESULTS: Rasch analyses indicate that nonmarijuana users rated primary prevention messages higher than secondary prevention messages, whereas marijuana users ranked secondary prevention messages more favorably than primary prevention messages., CONCLUSION: Interventions designed to address marijuana use among college students may be more effective if tailored toward user status. Specifically, primary prevention materials should be designed for abstainers, while secondary prevention messages that focus on harm reduction strategies should be used with marijuana users.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kansagara, Devan</author><author>O'Neil, Maya</author><author>Nugent, Shannon</author><author>Freeman, Michele</author><author>Low, Allison</author><author>Kondo, Karli</author><author>Elven, Camille</author><author>Zakher, Bernadette</author><author>Motu'apuaka, Makalapua</author><author>Paynter, Robin</author><author>Morasco, Benjamin J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No Title</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>Department of Veterans Affairs (US)</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29369568</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Eight states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis use for recreational purposes, and 28 states plus the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis for medical purposes.

There is a paucity of data on the impact of legalization of cannabis use on hospitalizations due to cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS)., AIM: To study the trends in CVS-related hospitalizations and cannabis use in CVS in relation to legalization of recreational cannabis use in Colorado., METHODS: All hospital admissions in Colorado between 2010 -2014 with the diagnosis of CVS were identified using the Colorado State Inpatient Database (SID). Five-year trends in CVS-related hospitalizations along with the cannabis use were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine predictors of cannabis use in CVS., RESULTS: There was a significant increase in CVS- related hospitalizations by 46% from 806 in 2010 to 1,180 in 2014 when CVS was included as all-listed diagnoses (P&lt;0.001). The overall prevalence of cannabis use in CVS (13% with CVS as primary diagnosis and 17% with CVS as all-listed diagnoses) was much higher than non-CVS related hospitalizations (1.7%) (P&lt;0.001 for both comparisons). Cannabis use increased dramatically in both CVS and non-CVS related hospitalizations following legalization of cannabis for recreational use in 2012., CONCLUSION: Our study shows a significant increase in CVS-related hospitalizations concomitant with an increase in cannabis use with its liberalization in Colorado. Future studies on the relationship between cannabis use and hyperemesis are warranted, especially with its ongoing legalization in the US. This article is protected by copyright.

A family of endocannabinoid receptors is susceptible to cannabis constituents. Cannabis is widely used in our society and following its recent legalization in Canada, we focus on how exposure to cannabis and pharmacologic cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CB1) inhibition affect lipoprotein levels., RECENT FINDINGS: Several groups have reported that exposure to cannabis does not increase weight despite the marked increase in caloric intake. In observational studies, the effect of smoked cannabis exposure on plasma lipids is variable. Some studies in specific patient populations with longer exposure to cannabis seemed to identify slightly more favorable lipoprotein profiles in the exposed group. Several larger controlled clinical trials using orally administered rimonabant, a CB1 receptor antagonist, have consistently shown relative improvements in weight and plasma levels of triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol among patients receiving the treatment., SUMMARY: The widely variable findings on the relationship of cannabis in various forms with plasma lipids preclude any definitive conclusions. Cannabis has complex effects on the cardiovascular system and its effects on lipid profile must be considered in this overall context. Further properly controlled research is required to better understand this topic.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shi, Yuyan</author><author>Liang, Di</author><author>Bao, Yuhua</author><author>An, Ruopeng</author><author>Wallace, Mark S</author><author>Grant, Igor</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recreational marijuana legalization and prescription opioids received by Medicaid enrollees.</title><secondary-title>Drug and alcohol dependence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug and alcohol dependence</full-title></periodical><pages>13-19</pages><volume>194</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>Ireland</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.09.016</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30390550</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OBJECTIVES: Medical marijuana use may substitute prescription opioid use, whereas nonmedical marijuana use may be a risk factor of prescription opioid misuse. This study examined the associations between recreational marijuana legalization and prescription opioids received by Medicaid enrollees., METHODS: State-level quarterly prescription drug utilization records for Medicaid enrollees during 2010-2017 were obtained from Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data. The primary outcome, opioid prescriptions received, was measured in three population-adjusted variables: number of opioid prescriptions, total doses of opioid prescriptions in morphine milligram equivalents, and related Medicaid spending, per quarter per 100 enrollees. Two difference-in-difference models were used to test the associations: eight states and DC that legalized recreational marijuana during the study period were first compared among themselves, then compared to six states with medical marijuana legalized before the study period. Schedule II and III opioids were analyzed separately., RESULTS: In models comparing eight states and DC, legalization was not associated with Schedule II opioid outcomes; having recreational marijuana legalization effective in 2015 was associated with reductions in number of prescriptions, total doses, and spending of Schedule III opioids by 32% (95% CI: (-49%, -15%), p = 0.003), 30% ((-55%, -4.4%), p = 0.027), and 31% ((-59%, -3.6%), p = 0.031), respectively. In models comparing eight states and DC to six states with medical marijuana legalization, recreational marijuana legalization was not associated with any opioid outcome., CONCLUSIONS: No evidence suggested that recreational marijuana legalization increased prescription opioids received by Medicaid enrollees. There was some evidence in some states for reduced Schedule III opioids following the legalization.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Fourteen states allow physicians to recommend marijuana or provide a legal defense for patients and physicians if prosecuted in state courts; however, little is known about those individuals using marijuana for medicinal purposes and the symptoms they use it for. This study provides descriptive information from 1,655 patients seeking a physician's recommendation for medical marijuana, the conditions for which they seek treatment, and the diagnoses made by the physicians. It conducts a systematic analysis of physician records and patient questionnaires obtained from consecutive patients being seen during a three month period at nine medical marijuana evaluation clinics belonging to a select medical group operating throughout the State of California. While this study is not representative of all medical marijuana users in California, it provides novel insights about an important population being affected by this policy.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fischer, Benedikt</author><author>Russell, Cayley</author><author>Rehm, Jurgen</author><author>Leece, Pamela</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the public health impact of cannabis legalization in Canada: core outcome indicators towards an 'index' for monitoring and evaluation.</title><secondary-title>Journal of public health (Oxford, England)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of public health (Oxford, England)</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdy090</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29860521</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The legalization of non-medical cannabis use and supply is impending in Canada. This constitutes a major policy change with the declared objective of improving public health outcomes, which requires rigorous monitoring and evaluation. While numerous different aspects associated with legalization will be examined, a focused perspective is required for effective policy evaluation purposes. To these ends, we have identified a set of 10 core indicators associated with cannabis-related risk/harm outcomes-based on current best evidence-that are expected to measure the primary impacts of legalization on public health outcomes. We briefly review these indicators, and their respective data availability in Canada. As ideally an integrated outcome assessment of cannabis legalization's impact on public health will be available, we further propose options to merge the individual indicators into an integrated, weighted 'index', considering their expected relative impact for public health. One possible approach to undertake this is 'multi-criteria decision analysis' as a method to weight the relative indicator impact on public health; alternative approaches are proposed. The integrated 'public health index' for cannabis legalization will allow for scientifically comprehensive, while focused, monitoring and evaluation of the effects of legalization in Canada for the benefits of science and evidence-based policy alike.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Azagba, Sunday</author><author>Asbridge, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Age of first use, current marijuana use and driving after use among Canadian high school students.</title><secondary-title>Addictive behaviors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Addictive behaviors</full-title></periodical><pages>329-333</pages><volume>90</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.11.042</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30503953</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Early exposure to marijuana may have lasting effects into adulthood given that adolescence is a critical period during which most substance use is initiated. Recreational marijuana recently became legal in Canada, with a legal age of purchase set as either 18 or 19years, depending on the province. Historically, the mean age of onset for marijuana use among youth occurs at a much younger age. The current study examined the association between age at first use of marijuana with current marijuana use patterns and driving after use among high school students. Data on 24,630 high school students (grades 9-12) were from the 2014-2015 Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey. We restricted our analyses to the students who reported having ever used marijuana and had data on age at first marijuana use (n=6709). Multivariable logistic and negative binomial regressions were performed to examine the association between current marijuana use patterns and age at first marijuana use. Students with younger age at first use of marijuana had significantly higher odds of current marijuana use, a higher frequency of consumption, and were more likely to drive after use of marijuana. Effective enforcement of age restriction laws in combination with other prevention efforts may be beneficial in delaying the age of onset of marijuana until late adolescence and early adulthood.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

We conducted an analysis of Ontario's birth registry to determine recent trends and correlates of cannabis use in pregnancy., METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study assembled from the Better Outcomes Registry &amp; Network (BORN) Ontario database, covering live births and stillbirths in Ontario between April 2012 and December 2017. Trends in self-reported cannabis use in pregnancy were analyzed according to maternal age and area-level socio-economic status (SES) using log binomial regression analysis., RESULTS: A total of 10,731 women reported cannabis use in pregnancy. Prevalence increased from 1.2% in 2012 to 1.8% in 2017 (p-trend, &lt; 0.001), equivalent to a relative increase of 61% (relative risk [RR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51 to 1.72). The crude prevalence of cannabis use in pregnancy among women aged 15 to 24 years and in the lowest two area-level income quintiles was 6.7%, compared to 0.3% among women aged 35 years and over in the highest three income quintiles (RR 24.59, 95% CI 21.98 to 27.52). A majority (52.0%) of cannabis users were aged 15-24 years and 54.7% of users were in the lowest two income quintiles., CONCLUSION: Cannabis use in pregnancy has increased since 2012 in Ontario and was reported in about 2% of pregnancies in 2017. Increases were predominately among women of younger ages and those of lower SES, and these groups account for half of users. Promoting cannabis cessation in pregnancy could lead to improved perinatal and later childhood outcomes and reduce health inequalities.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>National Academies of Sciences  and Medicine, Engineering</author><author>Division, Health and Medicine</author><author>Practice, Board on Population Health and Public Health</author><author>Agenda, Committee on the Health Effects of Marijuana: An Evidence Review and Research</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No Title</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><publisher>National Academies Press (US)</publisher><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.17226/24625</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=28182367</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Significant changes have taken place in the policy landscape surrounding cannabis legalization, production, and use. During the past 20 years, 25 states and the District of Columbia have legalized cannabis and/or cannabidiol (a component of cannabis) for medical conditions or retail sales at the state level and 4 states have legalized both the medical and recreational use of cannabis. These landmark changes in policy have impacted cannabis use patterns and perceived levels of risk. However, despite this changing landscape, evidence regarding the short- and long-term health effects of cannabis use remains elusive. While a myriad of studies have examined cannabis use in all its various forms, often these research conclusions are not appropriately synthesized, translated for, or communicated to policy makers, health care providers, state health officials, or other stakeholders who have been charged with influencing and enacting policies, procedures, and laws related to cannabis use. Unlike other controlled substances such as alcohol or tobacco, no accepted standards for safe use or appropriate dose are available to help guide individuals as they make choices regarding the issues of if, when, where, and how to use cannabis safely and, in regard to therapeutic uses, effectively. Shifting public sentiment, conflicting and impeded scientific research, and legislative battles have fueled the debate about what, if any, harms or benefits can be attributed to the use of cannabis or its derivatives, and this lack of aggregated knowledge has broad public health implications. The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids provides a comprehensive review of scientific evidence related to the health effects and potential therapeutic benefits of cannabis. This report provides a research agenda-outlining gaps in current knowledge and opportunities for providing additional insight into these issues-that summarizes and prioritizes pressing research needs.Copyright 2017 by the National Academy of Sciences.

Nowadays, it is recognized as the active component of marijuana, the drug with the highest rates of illicit use and abuse worldwide according to data provided by the World Health Organization. A huge debate has emerged in these past years with the growing interest to employ cannabis-based products with therapeutic purposes, a strategy that has increased in various European countries, Canada and more than half of the states that conform the United States, simultaneously with an important increase of flexibility in laws and regulations regarding the recreational use of this substance, especially in North America. Although valid arguments can exist for each side, the potential therapeutic use of substances that have ethical-legal implications such as the case of cannabis, require the prescribing doctor to be knowledgeable and to always be updated on the subject, a robust doctor-patient relationship and educational campaigns with truthful information that allow for full awareness of risks vs benefits.Copyright © 2018 IMSS.

This ambitious policy was also an unexpected one: none of the usual explanations for legalization of marijuana in other contexts was present in the Uruguayan case. This paper offers an explanation for why Uruguay legalized marijuana. Drawing on Kingdon's theoretical approach, we argue that a window of opportunity opened in mid-2012, making it both necessary and possible for the government to move towards legalization., METHODS: A congruence case study using evidence from a series of interviews with political actors and policy makers, media reports, and official documents., RESULTS: There is evidence that marijuana legalization was possible in Uruguay because of the coincidence of a demand for more public safety (problem stream) with the presence of pro-legalization leaders in strategic political positions (policy stream) and a favorable political environment (political stream) CONCLUSIONS: Applying Kingdon's theory of windows of opportunity, Uruguay may have moved toward full regulation of its marijuana market in 2013 because of the convergence of a specific set of problem, policy, and political circumstances in May 2012.Copyright This article is protected by copyright.

This study examined the longitudinal association between cannabis use and alcohol use among people living with HIV and explored the moderating role of medicinal vs. recreational cannabis use., METHOD: Participants were cannabis users (N=763) enrolled in the Ontario HIV Treatment Network Cohort Study (67% White, 88% male, 68% gay, median income in the $40,000-$50,000 range). Participants completed assessments of cannabis use, reasons for cannabis use, and alcohol use at baseline and at annual follow-ups (M = 3.42 completed assessments). Multilevel modeling was used to examine between-person and within-person associations between cannabis use and alcohol use over time., RESULTS: Greater average frequency of cannabis use was associated with greater average alcohol consumption across participants. Participants classified as medicinal cannabis users reported more frequent cannabis use and less alcohol use on average than recreational cannabis users. Further, within-person changes in cannabis use over time were positively associated with corresponding changes in alcohol use for recreational cannabis users but not for medicinal users., CONCLUSION: Cannabis use and alcohol use were positively associated over time among people living with HIV, although this association was specific to those using cannabis for recreational reasons. As alcohol use in this population poses significant health risks, more research on the link between cannabis use and alcohol use is needed, particularly in light of recent changes to cannabis regulations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

A bidirectional relationship was observed with tobacco use at baseline leading to depression at follow-up (OR = 1.87, CI = 1.23-2.85) and depression at baseline leading to tobacco use at follow-up (OR = 1.22, CI = 1.09-1.37). A unidirectional relationship was also observed with cannabis use leading to depression (OR = 1.33, CI = 1.19-1.49)., CONCLUSION: This study offers insights into the association and directionality between mental health disorders and substance use among adolescents and young adults.

However, many of the discussions were simplified to the notion that states either have a medical marijuana law or do not; little reference was made to the fact that legal provisions differ across states. This study seeks to clarify the characteristics of medical marijuana laws in place since 1990 that are most relevant to consumers/patients and categorizes those aspects most likely to affect the prevalence of use, and consequently the intensity of public health and welfare effects. Evidence shows treating medical marijuana laws as homogeneous across states is misleading and does not reflect the reality of medical marijuana lawmaking. This variation likely has implications for use and health outcomes, and thus states' public health.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Corroon, James M Jr</author><author>Mischley, Laurie K</author><author>Sexton, Michelle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs - a cross-sectional study.</title><secondary-title>Journal of pain research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of pain research</full-title></periodical><pages>989-998</pages><volume>10</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>New Zealand</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.2147/JPR.S134330</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=28496355</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: The use of medical cannabis is increasing, most commonly for pain, anxiety and depression. Emerging data suggest that use and abuse of prescription drugs may be decreasing in states where medical cannabis is legal. The aim of this study was to survey cannabis users to determine whether they had intentionally substituted cannabis for prescription drugs., METHODS: A total of 2,774 individuals were a self-selected convenience sample who reported having used cannabis at least once in the previous 90 days. Subjects were surveyed via an online anonymous questionnaire on cannabis substitution effects. Participants were recruited through social media and cannabis dispensaries in Washington State., RESULTS: A total of 1,248 (46%) respondents reported using cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs. The most common classes of drugs substituted were narcotics/opioids (35.8%), anxiolytics/benzodiazepines (13.6%) and antidepressants (12.7%). A total of 2,473 substitutions were reported or approximately two drug substitutions per affirmative respondent. The odds of reporting substituting were 4.59 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.87-5.43) greater among medical cannabis users compared with non-medical users and 1.66 (95% CI, 1.27-2.16) greater among those reporting use for managing the comorbidities of pain, anxiety and depression. A slightly higher percentage of those who reported substituting resided in states where medical cannabis was legal at the time of the survey (47% vs. 45%, p=0.58), but this difference was not statistically significant., DISCUSSION: These patient-reported outcomes support prior research that individuals are using cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs, particularly, narcotics/opioids, and independent of whether they identify themselves as medical or non-medical users. This is especially true if they suffer from pain, anxiety and depression. Additionally, this study suggests that state laws allowing access to, and use of, medical cannabis may not be influencing individual decision-making in this area.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Russo, Ethan B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Current Therapeutic Cannabis Controversies and Clinical Trial Design Issues.</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in pharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in pharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>309</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>Switzerland</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fphar.2016.00309</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=27683558</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This overview covers a wide range of cannabis topics, initially examining issues in dispensaries and self-administration, plus regulatory requirements for production of cannabis-based medicines, particularly the Food and Drug Administration &quot;Botanical Guidance.&quot; The remainder pertains to various cannabis controversies that certainly require closer examination if the scientific, consumer, and governmental stakeholders are ever to reach consensus on safety issues, specifically: whether botanical cannabis displays herbal synergy of its components, pharmacokinetics of cannabis and dose titration, whether cannabis medicines produce cyclo-oxygenase inhibition, cannabis-drug interactions, and cytochrome P450 issues, whether cannabis randomized clinical trials are properly blinded, combatting the placebo effect in those trials via new approaches, the drug abuse liability (DAL) of cannabis-based medicines and their regulatory scheduling, their effects on cognitive function and psychiatric sequelae, immunological effects, cannabis and driving safety, youth usage, issues related to cannabis smoking and vaporization, cannabis concentrates and vape-pens, and laboratory analysis for contamination with bacteria and heavy metals. Finally, the issue of pesticide usage on cannabis crops is addressed. New and disturbing data on pesticide residues in legal cannabis products in Washington State are presented with the observation of an 84.6% contamination rate including potentially neurotoxic and carcinogenic agents.

The extent of their use from a population perspective is unknown; hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate trends in pharmaceutical cannabinoid use in Manitoba., METHODS: This was a retrospective population-based cross-sectional study using administrative data from the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Pharmaceutical cannabinoid users residing in Manitoba from Apr. 1, 2004, to Mar. 31, 2015 were identified. We assessed the annual prevalence and incidence of pharmaceutical cannabinoid use, and the sociodemographic characteristics and medical conditions of users., RESULTS: We identified 5181 people who received at least 1 prescription for a pharmaceutical cannabinoid over the study period, 5033 of whom received their first prescription after Apr. 1, 2004. Nabilone accounted for 73 650 (96.0%) of all prescriptions dispensed; dronabinol was discontinued during the study period. The annual prevalence rate of use increased by 527.2%, from 21.5 (95% confidence interval [CI] 21.4-21.6) users per 100 000 people in 2004/05 to 134.9 (95% CI 134.7-135.1) users per 100 000 people in 2014/15. The annual incidence rate increased by 413.3%, from 12.1 (95% CI 12.1-12.2) users per 100 000 person-years in 2004/05 to 62.2 (95% CI 62.1-62.4) users per 100 000 person-years in 2014/15. The highest use was among older adults aged 46-64 years, females and urban area residents. One-third of incident users (1775 [35.3%]) had a diagnosis of fibromyalgia in a 2-year period before their first cannabinoid prescription. General practitioners initiated almost half (2350 [46.7%]) of first prescriptions, and anesthesiologists/pain specialists initiated one-quarter (1299 [25.8%])., INTERPRETATION: The prevalence and incidence of pharmaceutical cannabinoid use increased over time. These findings provide insight into the use of cannabinoids before the introduction of recreational marijuana, which may affect this trend.Copyright 2018, Joule Inc. or its licensors.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seale, J Paul</author><author>Johnson, J Aaron</author><author>Cline, Nicholas</author><author>Buchanan, Christopher</author><author>Kiker, Chris</author><author>Cochran, Lindsey</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Drug screening and changing marijuana policy: Validation of new single question drug screening tools.</title><secondary-title>Drug and alcohol dependence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug and alcohol dependence</full-title></periodical><pages>104-109</pages><volume>193</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>Ireland</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.08.030</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30352333</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Illicit drug use is common in U.S. medical settings. A validated Single Drug Screening Question (SDSQ) containing the word &quot;illegal&quot; is widely used. As marijuana policies change, the present wording may not perform as expected in states legalizing use. This study compares the performance of the validated SDSQ with three different SDSQ wordings., METHODS: Patients, 18 years and older, presenting to a U.S. hospital emergency department were asked to complete a survey containing the existing SDSQ, three new SDSQ versions without the word &quot;illegal,&quot; and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Patients were also encouraged to provide a sample for saliva drug testing., RESULTS: Of 297 eligible patients, 200 (67.3%) completed the survey and 141 (70.5% of interview participants) completed saliva testing. Overlapping confidence intervals on the Area Under the Curve (AUC) analysis confirmed that sensitivities of all SDSQs were statistically similar for detecting self-reported drug use (65-71%). Combining questionnaire and saliva testing increased drug use detection by 2% and resulted in lower SDSQ sensitivity (58-67%). Specificities were 99-100%. The SDSQ with the highest sensitivity was: &quot;In the last twelve months, did you smoke pot (marijuana), use another street drug, or use a prescription medication &quot;recreationally&quot; (just for the feeling, or using more than prescribed)?&quot;, CONCLUSIONS: All four SDSQs demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and high specificity. Removing the term 'illegal' does not result in higher, or lower, reported drug use, though results could vary in states with legalized marijuana. Future research should replicate this study in one or more of these states.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the lack of evidence to validate the effectiveness and safety of marijuana, it is approved to treat a variety of dermatologic conditions in the United States. Furthermore, medical cannabis dispensaries have been making unsubstantiated claims about medical cannabis. It is important for dermatologists to know about the purported use of medical cannabis to help patients navigate this new treatment option, particularly as cannabis becomes legal in Canada in October 2018. We collected and tabulated the dermatologic indications for medical cannabis from Canada, the United States, and Europe. In the United States, dermatologic-approved indications vary by state but include psoriasis, lupus, nail-patella syndrome, and severe pain. Health Canada has listed psoriasis, dermatitis, and pruritus as potential therapeutic uses for cannabis but does not endorse its use for therapeutic purposes. We also surveyed the websites of dispensaries in Canada, the United States, and Europe and found that numerous unsubstantiated claims were being made and advertised to consumers. Dermatologic uses of medical cannabis, as claimed by dispensaries, included treating acne, aging, allergic contact dermatitis, chronic pain, herpes, dermatitis, lupus, Lyme disease, nevi, psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa, and melanoma. Psoriasis, dermatitis, and chronic pain were the most commonly cited indications for medical cannabis listed by dispensaries. Our data indicate that the suggested and advertised uses of medical cannabis are largely unsubstantiated. Further research is necessary to validate the indications, effectiveness, and safety of medical cannabis.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turgeman, Ilit</author><author>Bar-Sela, Gil</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cannabis for cancer - illusion or the tip of an iceberg: a review of the evidence for the use of Cannabis and synthetic cannabinoids in oncology.</title><secondary-title>Expert opinion on investigational drugs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Expert opinion on investigational drugs</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13543784.2019.1561859</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30572744</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>INTRODUCTION: A flowering plant of variegated ingredients and psychoactive qualities, Cannabis has long been used for medicinal and recreational purposes. Regulatory approvals have been gained across a broad range of palliative and therapeutic indications, and in some cases, included in standard treatment guidelines. Areas covered: The use of Cannabis and cannabinoid-based-medicines in oncology is summarized in this article. Cannabinoids were classified according to natural and synthetic subtypes and their mechanisms of action expounded. The variability of available products is discussed in the clinical context and data regarding chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, cancer-related pain, anorexia, insomnia and anxiety are presented. Moreover, immunological and antineoplastic effects in preclinical and clinical trials are addressed. Concepts such as synergism or opposition with conventional treatment modalities, sequence of administration and dosage, molecular cross-talk and malignancy-cannabinoid congruence, are explored. Finally, side-effects, limitations in trial design and legislation barriers are related. Expert opinion: Sufficient evidence supports use of Cannabis for palliative indications in oncology, however, patients should be carefully selected, guided and followed. Promising research suggests potent antineoplastic activity, but more data must be accrued before conclusions can be drawn.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goodman, Samantha</author><author>Leos-Toro, Cesar</author><author>Hammond, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Methods to Assess Cannabis Consumption in Population Surveys: Results of Cognitive Interviewing.</title><secondary-title>Qualitative health research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Qualitative health research</full-title></periodical><pages>1049732318820523</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1049732318820523</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30600773</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Cannabis Act legalized the possession and sale of nonmedical cannabis in Canada on October 17, 2018. Evaluating the impact of cannabis legalization requires a more thorough understanding than is provided by most existing measures of cannabis use. The aim of this study was to pretest a range of cannabis consumption measures used in a population-based survey and to share insights gained in the process. Cognitive interviewing was conducted among 10 cannabis users aged &gt;=16 years. Comprehension and self-reporting of consumption types and amounts, sources of purchase, and cannabinoid levels were examined. Findings revealed areas for improvement in a number of survey items, including unclear wording and reference images. Identified issues were used to improve the survey for use in the International Cannabis Policy Study. The authors discuss important principles (e.g., use of visual cues, user-selected units, and time frames) that should be adopted when assessing cannabis use in population-based studies.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chow, Robert M</author><author>Marascalchi, Bryan</author><author>Abrams, Winfred B</author><author>Peiris, Nathalie A</author><author>Odonkor, Charles A</author><author>Cohen, Steven P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Driving Under the Influence of Cannabis: A Framework for Future Policy.</title><secondary-title>Anesthesia and analgesia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anesthesia and analgesia</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1213/ANE.0000000000003575</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29933274</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Marijuana is the most widely consumed illicit substance in the United States, and an increasing number of states have legalized it for both medicinal and recreational purposes. As it becomes more readily available, there will be a concurrent rise in the number of users and, consequently, the number of motor vehicle operators driving under the influence. This article examines the cognitive and psychomotor effects of cannabis, as well as current policy concerning driving under the influence of drugs. The authors performed a MEDLINE search on the epidemiology of cannabis use, its cognitive and psychomotor effects, and policies regarding driving under the influence of drugs. Twenty-eight epidemiological studies, 16 acute cognitive and psychomotor studies, 8 chronic cognitive and psychomotor studies, and pertinent state and federal laws and policies were reviewed. These search results revealed that marijuana use is associated with significant cognitive and psychomotor effects. In addition, the legalization of marijuana varies from state to state, as do the laws pertaining to driving under the influence of drugs. Marijuana is a commonly found illicit substance in motor vehicle operators driving under the influence of drugs. Current evidence shows that blood levels of tetrahydrocannabinol do not correlate well with the level of impairment. In addition, although acute infrequent use of cannabis typically leads to cognitive and psychomotor impairment, this is not consistently the case for chronic heavy use. To establish the framework for driving under the influence of cannabis policy, we must review the current published evidence and examine existing policy at state and federal levels.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anonymous</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>No Title</title></titles><periodical/><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><publisher>Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health</publisher><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=25411664</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cannabis has been used medically for its antiemetic, sedative, and analgesic effects and for its ability to stimulate appetite. The major psychoactive ingredient of cannabis is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Nabilone is a synthetic cannabinoid analog of THC and is approved for use in Canada for the treatment of severe nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy in adults over the age of 18 years. For its approved indication, nabilone (1 mg to 2 mg) is used short-term, administered the night before and one to three hours prior to chemotherapy and can be continued up to 24 hours following chemotherapy. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found that 70% of patients undergoing chemotherapy who received cannabinoids had complete control of nausea compared to 57% of placebo patients (RR 1.21; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.42). As well, 66% of patients had complete control of vomiting with cannabinoids compared to 36% of patients treated with placebo (RR 1.84; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.38). Nabilone exerts its therapeutic effect by acting as an agonist at the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, a receptor that has a role in the regulation of nausea and vomiting, appetite, movement, and pain. As such, nabilone has the potential to be used 'off-label' for a number of conditions, for example, in the management of nausea and vomiting attributed to factors other than chemotherapy. In addition, the appetite stimulating properties of cannabinoids have been used to manage problematic or excessive weight loss secondary to medical conditions, such as AIDS and cancers. This report will review the evidence of clinical effectiveness and safety of nabilone when used for the treatment of non-chemotherapy related nausea and vomiting and to manage weight loss attributed to medical conditions.Copyright © 2014 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, Renee M</author><author>Fleming, Charles B</author><author>Cambron, Christopher</author><author>Dean, Lorraine T</author><author>Brighthaupt, Sherri-Chanelle</author><author>Guttmannova, Katarina</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Race/Ethnicity Differences in Trends of Marijuana, Cigarette, and Alcohol Use Among 8th, 10th, and 12th Graders in Washington State, 2004-2016.</title><secondary-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11121-018-0899-0</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29633175</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Accurate estimates of substance use in the teenage years by race/ethnicity may help identify when to intervene to prevent long-term substance use disparities. We examined trends in past 30-day use of marijuana, cigarette, and alcohol among 8th, 10th, and 12th graders in Washington State, which passed a recreational marijuana law in 2012 and initiated retail marijuana sales in 2014. Data are from the 2004-2016 Washington Healthy Youth Surveys (n = 161,992). We used time series regression models to assess linear and quadratic trends in substance use for the full sample and stratified on race/ethnicity and grade level and examined relative differences in prevalence of use by race/ethnicity. In Washington, across all racial/ethnic groups, marijuana use peaked in 2012. Although there was not a significant overall change in marijuana use for the full sample across the study period, there was a statistically significant increase in use among 12th graders and a statistically significant decrease among 8th graders. Relative to Whites, Asians had a lower prevalence of marijuana use, whereas all other race/ethnicity groups had a higher prevalence of use. Prevalence of marijuana use is particularly high among American Indian/Alaska Native and Black youth and has increased most rapidly among 12th grade Hispanic/Latinx youth. There were large and statistically significant decreases in alcohol and cigarette use across the study period for the full sample, as well as for each race/ethnicity group. These findings highlight the need for continued monitoring of trends in use among these groups and potentially warrant consideration of selective interventions that specifically focus on students of color and that include developmentally-appropriate strategies relevant to each grade.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brooks-Russell, Ashley</author><author>Ma, Ming</author><author>Levinson, Arnold H</author><author>Kattari, Leo</author><author>Kirchner, Tom</author><author>Anderson Goodell, Erin M</author><author>Johnson, Renee M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adolescent Marijuana Use, Marijuana-Related Perceptions, and Use of Other Substances Before and After Initiation of Retail Marijuana Sales in Colorado (2013-2015).</title><secondary-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11121-018-0933-2</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30043198</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Due to the recentness of changes to marijuana policies in a number of states, the effect on adolescent use and perceptions is not yet well understood. This study examines change in adolescent marijuana use and related perceptions in Colorado, before and after the implementation of legal commercial sale of recreational marijuana for adults starting on January 1, 2014. The data are from a repeated cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of Colorado high school students, with separately drawn samples surveyed in fall 2013 (prior to implementation) and fall 2015 (18 months after implementation). We examined change in the prevalence of adolescent marijuana use, measured by lifetime use, past 30-day use, frequent use, and use on school property. To consider the possibility of heterogeneity in the change in marijuana use, we examined change in past 30-day marijuana use by demographic characteristics (sex, grade, race/ethnicity), school characteristics (poverty, percent minority), urbanicity of the school district, and whether the city or county permitted retail marijuana stores. There was an absence of significant effects for change in lifetime or past 30-day marijuana use. Among those reporting past 30-day use, frequent use and use on school property declined. There was a significant decline in the perceived harm associated with marijuana use, but we did not find a significant effect for perceived wrongfulness, perceived ease of access, or perceived parental disapproval. We did not find significant variability in past 30-day use by demographic characteristics or by school and community factors from 2013 to 2015. We did not find a significant effect associated with the introduction of legal sales of recreational marijuana to adults in Colorado on adolescent (illegal) use, but ongoing monitoring is warranted, including consideration of heterogeneity in the effects of marijuana policies.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Paschall, Mallie J</author><author>Flewellng, Robert L</author><author>Grube, Joel W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Statewide Youth Surveys to Evaluate Local Drug Use Policies and Interventions.</title><secondary-title>Contemporary drug problems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contemporary drug problems</full-title></periodical><pages>427-446</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>3/4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2009</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=20155216</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This article summarizes two studies that use statewide school-based youth surveys to evaluate local initiatives to reduce alcohol and other substance abuse. The Vermont &quot;New Directions&quot; evaluation was conducted to assess the effects of a community-based intervention in 23 Vermont communities to reduce youth substance use. Outcome data were obtained from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey, which is administered to students in grades 8 through 12 every other year in almost all school districts in the state. Based on a quasi-experimental design, results indicated significant declines in cigarette and marijuana use in intervention districts relative to comparison districts during the study period, and led to legislative action to continue funding the initiative. The Oregon &quot;Reducing Youth Access to Alcohol&quot; study is now being conducted in 36 Oregon communities (45 school districts) with a randomized controlled design to evaluate six combined environmental strategies to reduce underage drinking. The strategies include a reward and reminder program and minor decoy operations to reduce commercial alcohol availability, party patrol dispersal and minor in possession arrests to reduce social alcohol availability, traffic emphasis, and media advocacy to increase visibility of policy enforcement activities. The Oregon Healthy Teens Survey has been administered in a large number of Oregon school districts annually since 2000 and is being used to assess intervention effects on alcohol availability, underage drinking and alcohol-related problems such as DUI. These studies illustrate how established statewide youth surveys offer important advantages for evaluating local substance abuse prevention policies and interventions.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haines-Saah, Rebecca J</author><author>Mitchell, Sarah</author><author>Slemon, Allie</author><author>Jenkins, Emily K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>'Parents are the best prevention'?

Set against this context, the aim of our paper is to amplify the parent perspective on preventing problematic adolescent cannabis use, but also to interrogate the idea of 'parents as the best prevention' that has taken hold in discussions about the potential consequences of legalization for youth., METHODS: In 2016 we undertook an exploratory, qualitative interview study in Vancouver, British Columbia (n=16) with parents of adolescents who had used cannabis. Building on our past research developing educator-led resources to support an open dialogue about cannabis in the classroom, in this study we asked parents about the supports and resources they needed to inform their discussions about cannabis with their adolescent children, as well the challenges they faced in responding to cannabis use when they believed it had become problematic., FINDINGS: Across the interviews, parents mobilized discourses of risk and responsibility for preventing problematic cannabis use that appeared to reinstate individualizing accounts of substance use. Many echoed normative ideas about health, the risks of cannabis use, and 'good' parenting, sidestepping social inequities around drug use, and thus implicating parents and families as solely responsible for preventing adolescent drug use., CONCLUSION: Our analysis suggests how parents have been largely disempowered and unsupported when it comes to addressing adolescent drug use in the family context. Even as they expressed their awareness that formal supports and resources to assist them were lacking, parents also assigned blame to themselves - or to other parents - for 'failing' to prevent problematic cannabis use.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Notably, excessive gambling is associated with many physical and emotional health harms, including depression, suicidal ideation, substance use and addiction and greater utilization of health care resources. Gambling also demonstrates a similar 'dose-response' relationship as alcohol-the more one gambles, the greater the likelihood of harm. Using the same collaborative, evidence-informed approach that produced Canada's Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking and Lower Risk Cannabis Use Guidelines, a research team is leading the development of the first national Low-Risk Gambling Guidelines (LRGGs) that will include quantitative thresholds for safe gambling. This paper describes the research methodology and the decision-making process for the project. The guidelines will be derived through secondary analyses of several large population datasets from Canada and other countries, including both cross-sectional and longitudinal data on over 50 000 adults. A scientific committee will pool the results and put forward recommendations for LRGGs to a nationally representative, multi-agency advisory committee for endorsement. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic attempt to generate a workable set of LRGGs from population data. Once validated, the guidelines inform public health policy and prevention initiatives and will be disseminated to addiction professionals, policy makers, regulators, communication experts and the gambling industry. The availability of the LRGGs will help the general public make well-informed decisions about their gambling activities and reduce the harms associated with gambling.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Szkudlarek, Hanna J</author><author>Desai, Sagar J</author><author>Renard, Justine</author><author>Pereira, Brian</author><author>Norris, Christopher</author><author>Jobson, Christina E L</author><author>Rajakumar, Nagalingam</author><author>Allman, Brian L</author><author>Laviolette, Steven R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>DELTA-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol and Cannabidiol produce dissociable effects on prefrontal cortical executive function and regulation of affective behaviors.</title><secondary-title>Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41386-018-0282-7</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30538288</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The use of cannabis for therapeutic and recreational purposes is growing exponentially. Nevertheless, substantial questions remain concerning the potential cognitive and affective side-effects associated with cannabis exposure. In particular, the effects of specific marijuana-derived phytocannabinoids on neural regions such as the prefrontal cortex (PFC) are of concern, given the role of the PFC in both executive cognitive function and affective processing. The main biologically active phytocannabinoids, -9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), interact with multiple neurotransmitter systems important for these processes directly within the PFC. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that acute or chronic THC exposure may induce psychotomimetic effects, whereas CBD has been shown to produce potentially therapeutic effects for both psychosis and/or anxiety-related symptoms. Using an integrative combination of cognitive and affective behavioral pharmacological assays in rats, we report that acute intra-PFC infusions of THC produce anxiogenic effects while producing no impairments in executive function. In contrast, acute infusions of intra-PFC CBD impaired attentional set-shifting and spatial working memory, without interfering with anxiety or sociability behaviors. In contrast, intra-PFC CBD reversed the cognitive impairments induced by acute glutamatergic antagonism within the PFC, and blocked the anxiogenic properties of THC, suggesting that the therapeutic properties of CBD within the PFC may be present only during pathologically aberrant states within the PFC. Interestingly, the effects of PFC THC vs. CBD were found to be mediated through dissociable CB1 vs. 5-HT1A-dependent receptor signaling mechanisms, directly in the PFC.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moore, Hadass</author><author>Astor, Ron Avi</author><author>Benbenishty, Rami</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Substance use off and on school grounds: A California statewide comparison between different groups of homeless students and nonhomeless students.</title><secondary-title>Addictive behaviors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Addictive behaviors</full-title></periodical><pages>141-147</pages><volume>92</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.12.006</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30640145</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>About 1.3 million homeless students attend schools across the US, yet little is known about their substance use patterns, especially substance use on school grounds. The objectives of this study were to examine differences in substance use on and off school grounds between nonsheltered homeless, sheltered homeless, and nonhomeless public school students, and to examine the relationship between homelessness and substance use in school. Data were from a statewide representative sample from the California Healthy Kids Survey collected in 2011-2013, (n=390,028). Bivariate and multivariate analyses were applied. Findings show that compared to nonhomeless students, homeless students, both sheltered and nonsheltered, reported higher rates of age at first time of use under the age of 10, and recent substance use, for an array of substances, indulging alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other illegal drugs. Additionally about 50% of nonsheltered homeless students, and 15% of sheltered homeless students reported having used substances in school in the past 30days. Results from logistic regressions indicate that homelessness is associated with substance use in school. Particularly, nonsheltered homeless students were 17.41, 12.09, 11.36 and 17.59 times more likely to report smoking cigarettes, drinking alcohol, using marijuana and using other illegal drugs (respectively) in school in the past 30days, compared to nonhomeless students. Sheltered homeless students were also more likely to use substances in school compared to nonhomeless students, but less likely compared to nonsheltered students. Findings highlight the need to develop differentiated school-based responses to each homeless subgroup and have conceptual, scientific and policy implications.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Training in responsible sales practices has been effective in the alcohol market. An online responsible marijuana vendor (RMV) training was produced and implemented with stores in a randomized trial., PROGRAM: An online RMV training was developed through meetings with state regulators and local law enforcement personnel, curriculum standards published by the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division in May 2015, interviews with recreational marijuana store personnel (n = 15), and usability testing of a prototype training with store personnel (n = 19) in Colorado and Washington State. The training contained 5 modules: state laws and regulations, ID checking, health effects of marijuana, customer service practices including recognizing intoxicated patrons, and rules of the trade., IMPLEMENTATION: A randomized controlled trial testing the training enrolled a random sample of state-licensed retail recreational marijuana stores (n = 225) in Colorado, Oregon, and Washington State. In total, 125 stores were randomly assigned to receive the RMV training. A total of 420 store employees completed the online training between June 2017 and February 2018 (43.5% female, 88.4% younger than 40 years, and 74.1% non-Hispanic white)., EVALUATION: Responses to posttraining surveys showed that most trainees found the training user-friendly (78.4%), were satisfied (68.8%), and would recommend it to another employee (91.1%). The training improved trainees' ability to check IDs (pretraining mean = 3.91 [SD = 1.36], posttraining mean = 4.58 [SD = 0.66], t387,388 = 8.68, P &lt; .001) and their confidence to use the state's inventory tracking system (pretraining mean = 2.52 [SD = 0.65], posttraining mean = 2.85 [SD = 0.39], t387, 388 = 10.89, P &lt; .001) and spot intoxicated customers (pretraining mean = 2.79 [SD = 0.41], posttraining mean = 2.94 [SD = 0.25], t387,388 = 6.87, P &lt; .001)., DISCUSSION: Online RMV training was acceptable to retail recreational marijuana personnel and potentially improved responsible sales practices. Responsible vendor training has been successful under certain conditions in the alcohol market and should be considered for the recreational marijuana market.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Premji, Shainur</author><author>McDonald, Sheila W</author><author>Zaychkowsky, Carol</author><author>Zwicker, Jennifer D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Supporting healthy pregnancies: Examining variations in nutrition, weight management and substance abuse advice provision by prenatal care providers in Alberta, Canada.

Within Canada, women choose to receive pregnancy care from one of a variety of publicly funded care providers. This study examines the association between the type of care provider(s) seen during pregnancy and the provision of advice related to nutrition, weight management and substance abuse., METHODS: Using data from the Alberta-based All Our Families prospective pregnancy cohort, we conducted bivariate and multivariate analyses to determine the likelihood of receiving advice related to nutrition, weight management, and substance abuse across provider(s) seen., RESULTS: Of 3341 women in our sample, 38% saw a single provider during pregnancy and 56% received care from multiple providers. Advice on nutrition was more likely to be provided across all providers, while weight management and substance abuse was less frequently and less consistently discussed. Relative to doctors in low-risk maternity clinics, midwives were most likely to provide nutrition (OR: 3.09, 95% CI: 1.19-8.01) and weight management (OR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.13-3.50) advice to women., CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that the type of prenatal advice received by women depends on the provider(s) seen during pregnancy. Substance abuse was least likely to be discussed across providers, suggesting important implications given recent cannabis legalization.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sagar, Kelly A</author><author>Gruber, Staci A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interactions between recreational cannabis use and cognitive function: lessons from functional magnetic resonance imaging.</title><secondary-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13990</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30426517</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cannabis use is becoming increasingly popular as a growing number of states pass legislation to legalize cannabis and cannabis-derived products for recreational and/or medical purposes. Given the widespread use of cannabis, it is critical to understand the neural consequences related to cannabis use. In this review, we focus on evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging studies that document acute and residual alterations in brain function during tasks spanning a variety of cognitive domains: executive function, attention and working memory, memory, motor skills, error monitoring, and reward and affective processing. Although it is clear that cannabis affects brain function, the findings are somewhat inconsistent; variables that potentially affect study outcomes are outlined, including a discussion of the impact of chronological age and age of cannabis onset as well as length of abstinence at the time of assessment, which are important considerations when measuring cannabis use patterns. Inherent differences between recreational/adult cannabis use versus use for medical purposes are also discussed, given their importance to public policy decisions.Copyright © 2018 New York Academy of Sciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haines-Saah, Rebecca J</author><author>Johnson, Joy L</author><author>Repta, Robin</author><author>Ostry, Aleck</author><author>Young, Mary Lynn</author><author>Shoveller, Jeannie</author><author>Sawatzky, Richard</author><author>Greaves, Lorraine</author><author>Ratner, Pamela A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The privileged normalization of marijuana use - an analysis of Canadian newspaper reporting, 1997-2007.</title><secondary-title>Critical public health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Critical public health</full-title></periodical><pages>47-61</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=24574580</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The objective of this study was to systematically examine predominant themes within mainstream media reporting about marijuana use in Canada. To ascertain the themes present in major Canadian newspaper reports, a sample (N = 1999) of articles published between 1997 and 2007 was analyzed. Drawing from Manning's theory of the symbolic framing of drug use within media, it is argued that a discourse of 'privileged normalization' informs portrayals of marijuana use and descriptions of the drug's users. Privileged normalization implies that marijuana use can be acceptable for some people at particular times and places, while its use by those without power and status is routinely vilified and linked to deviant behavior. The privileged normalization of marijuana by the media has important health policy implications in light of continued debate regarding the merits of decriminalization or legalization and the need for public health and harm reduction approaches to illicit drug use.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uhl, George R</author><author>Koob, George F</author><author>Cable, Jennifer</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The neurobiology of addiction.</title><secondary-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/nyas.13989</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30644552</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Substance and alcohol use disorders impose large health and economic burdens on individuals, families, communities, and society. Neither prevention nor treatment efforts are effective in all individuals. Results are often modest. Advances in neuroscience and addiction research have helped to describe the neurobiological changes that occur when a person transitions from recreational substance use to a substance use disorder or addiction. Understanding both the drivers and consequences of substance use in vulnerable populations, including those whose brains are still maturing, has revealed behavioral and biological characteristics that can increase risks of addiction. These findings are particularly timely, as law- and policymakers are tasked to reverse the ongoing opioid epidemic, as more states legalize marijuana, as new products including electronic cigarettes and newly designed abused substances enter the legal and illegal markets, and as &quot;deaths of despair&quot; from alcohol and drug misuse continue.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

We conducted an analysis of Ontario's birth registry to determine recent trends and correlates of cannabis use in pregnancy., METHODS: We conducted a population-based retrospective cohort study assembled from the Better Outcomes Registry &amp; Network (BORN) Ontario database, covering live births and stillbirths in Ontario between April 2012 and December 2017. Trends in self-reported cannabis use in pregnancy were analyzed according to maternal age and area-level socio-economic status (SES) using log binomial regression analysis., RESULTS: A total of 10,731 women reported cannabis use in pregnancy. Prevalence increased from 1.2% in 2012 to 1.8% in 2017 (p-trend, &lt; 0.001), equivalent to a relative increase of 61% (relative risk [RR] 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51 to 1.72). The crude prevalence of cannabis use in pregnancy among women aged 15 to 24 years and in the lowest two area-level income quintiles was 6.7%, compared to 0.3% among women aged 35 years and over in the highest three income quintiles (RR 24.59, 95% CI 21.98 to 27.52). A majority (52.0%) of cannabis users were aged 15-24 years and 54.7% of users were in the lowest two income quintiles., CONCLUSION: Cannabis use in pregnancy has increased since 2012 in Ontario and was reported in about 2% of pregnancies in 2017. Increases were predominately among women of younger ages and those of lower SES, and these groups account for half of users. Promoting cannabis cessation in pregnancy could lead to improved perinatal and later childhood outcomes and reduce health inequalities.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lo, Sheng-Ying</author><author>Winston-McPherson, Gabrielle N</author><author>Starosta, Amy J</author><author>Sullivan, Mark D</author><author>Baird, Geoffrey S</author><author>Hoofnagle, Andrew N</author><author>Greene, Dina N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cannabis Legalization Does Not Influence Patient Compliance with Opioid Therapy.</title><secondary-title>The American journal of medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The American journal of medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.amjmed.2018.11.002</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30419224</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Prescription opioid use and opioid related deaths continue to increase nationwide. Several states have adopted legislation allowing for recreational use of cannabis. Little is known about how recreational cannabis laws impact compliance in chronic pain patients who have been prescribed opioid therapy. The goals of this study were to (1) retrospectively assess the effect of cannabis use on compliance with opioid therapy in a high-risk patient population and (2) determine the impact of legalization of recreational cannabis on patients prescribed therapeutic opioids., METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study on results from a &quot;high-risk&quot; urine drug testing panel. Results from 1 year before and 1 year after initiation of recreational cannabis legislation were analyzed. This testing panel included qualitative assays for cannabinoids and 9 other common drugs of abuse in addition to a quantitative LC-MS/MS assay for 23 different opioids and metabolites. Opioid compliance was assigned by reviewing pathologists' interpretations., RESULTS: In the pre-legalization period, 1776 panels were performed, and in the post-legalization, 1648 panels were performed. An increase (6%) in the rate of positive cannabinoids screening results was observed after legalization of recreational cannabis; however, the overall compliance rate was consistent., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that legalization of recreational cannabis does not affect compliance rate in patients treated with opioid therapy for chronic pain.Copyright © 2018.

An initial qualitative analysis based on the principles of grounded theory was conducted. The main categories identified were then used to find and re-code relevant material on the respondents' experience with formal and informal control (secondary analysis)., RESULTS: The users' perspective shows that mechanisms of informal control play an important role in defining the social context of their use (when, where, and with whom cannabis is consumed). In contrast, formal control had no deterrent impact on the cessation or reduction of use, but affected their behavior by influencing them to change the context of their practices to avoid criminal legal consequences and stigmatization. Conclusions/Importance: The regulatory controls based in public health that the Canadian government plans to implement (replacing criminal ones), should be based on a better understanding of current practices and patterns of cannabis users, and in accordance with informal controls already in place. Legislative formal controls, in a regulatory model, that are better defined and consistent with social practices, will be more accepted and respected by the user population and thus likely to be more effective in reducing harm.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rusby, Julie C</author><author>Westling, Erika</author><author>Crowley, Ryann</author><author>Mills, Kathryn L</author><author>Light, John M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Associations between marijuana use and anxious mood lability during adolescence.</title><secondary-title>Addictive behaviors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Addictive behaviors</full-title></periodical><pages>89-94</pages><volume>92</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.12.029</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30597336</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To date, research investigating the association between adolescent marijuana use and anxiety is mixed, given differences in how anxiety is measured and the age ranges studied. The research is further limited as many relevant studies have small sample sizes. This investigation examines the association between marijuana use (use in the past 30days) and anxious mood lability (rapid fluctuation in emotional states) during early adolescence (average age 14.4, spring of 8th grade) through midadolescence (10th grade)., METHODS: Participating adolescents (N=466; 52.8% female) were from rural and suburban communities and 38% were Hispanic/Latino. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) was used to measure adolescents' anxious mood in real time; the EMAs were collected within 30days of the adolescent report of their marijuana use., RESULTS: Multilevel models with measurement waves (7 time points) nested in individuals showed that anxious mood lability was significantly higher for adolescents reporting recent marijuana use compared to those reporting no recent marijuana use. Although females were higher than males in anxious mood lability, the association between anxious mood lability and recent marijuana use did not differ by gender. Post hoc analysis showed that the associations between anxious mood lability and recent marijuana use did not differ between assessments conducted pre and post legalization of adult recreational marijuana use., CONCLUSIONS: The association between recent marijuana use and anxious mood lability for youth is important for understanding the developmental processes of cannabis use and anxious mood disorders in adolescence and young adulthood.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In AdoQuest, 1048 parents with children in grade 6 reported past-year cannabis use. Cannabis initiation among offspring was measured in grade 7, 9, and/or 11. In the Nicotine Dependence in Teens study, cannabis use data were available for 584 participants (mean age 24 years) and their parents (ie, 542 offspring-mother pairs, 438 offspring-father pairs). The association between parental and offspring cannabis use was estimated using multivariable logistic regression in both studies., RESULTS: In AdoQuest, grade 6 never-users were 1.8 times more likely to initiate cannabis during high school if their parents reported past-year use. In the Nicotine Dependence in Teens study, the aORs (95% CI) for past-year cannabis use among adult offspring were not different for &quot;mother uses cannabis&quot; (2.8 [1.4-5.8]) or &quot;father uses cannabis&quot; (2.1 [1.2-3.8]). Participants with 1 or 2 cannabis-using parents were 1.7 and 7.1 times more likely to use cannabis, respectively, than participants with non-using parents., CONCLUSIONS: To enable informed decision-making about their own cannabis use, parents need to be aware that children of cannabis users are more likely to use cannabis in adolescence and young adulthood.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The current study examined national trends in cannabis use among Canadian youth from 2004/05 to 2014/15 using nationally representative data from the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (CSTADS). Data were collected from students in Grades 7 to 12 as part of the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey (formerly the Youth Smoking Survey) using a repeat-cross sectional survey across 6 biennial survey waves between 2004 and 2014 (N=243,057). Regression models examined factors associated with cannabis use in the past 12months, perceived ease of access, and a multilinear regression examined age of initiation across survey cycles. The findings indicate that use of cannabis in the past 12-months significantly decreased among Canadian youth. Past-year use peaked in 2008/09 at 27.3%; compared to 16.5%, in 2014/15. Mean age of initiation did not vary over time, while youth in recent cycles reported that cannabis was more difficult to access: in 2006/07, 77.1% reported that it would be easy to access cannabis compared to 49.0% in 2014/15. Overall, cannabis use among Canadian youth appears to have peaked around 2008/09, with substantial declines over the past decade. It will be critically important to examine any changes in patterns of use following legalization of non-medical cannabis in Canada.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

During a ~6-year period from 2010 to early 2016, about 2,600 cases of suspected NPS intoxications were included in the project. About 75% of patients were men and the total age range was 8-71 (median 24) years and 57% were 25 years or younger. A large number of NPS belonging to many different drug classes were identified in project samples of urine and blood (serum/plasma) submitted for free drug testing, including synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonists, stimulants, cathinones, hallucinogens, dissociative drugs, benzodiazepines, and opioids, and also in drug materials from the cases forwarded to the laboratory along with the biological samples. The STRIDA project has been shown to serve as an effective early warning system for NPS by collecting data on incidence, distribution, and adverse effects and has supported healthcare professionals in the knowledge and critical care of intoxications caused by a wide range of novel substances. The results of the STRIDA project have also illustrated how drug regulations can drive the NPS market.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moreno, Megan A</author><author>Gower, Aubrey D</author><author>Jenkins, Marina C</author><author>Scheck, Josh</author><author>Sohal, Jaymin</author><author>Kerr, Bradley</author><author>Young, Henry N</author><author>Cox, Elizabeth</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Social Media Posts by Recreational Marijuana Companies and Administrative Code Regulations in Washington State.</title><secondary-title>JAMA network open</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA network open</full-title></periodical><pages>e182242</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.2242</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30646364</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Importance: Recreational marijuana use was legalized in the state of Washington in 2012, and the Washington Administrative Code (WAC) 314-55-155 was implemented to limit the exposure of youths to marijuana advertisements., Objectives: To evaluate the content of social media posts by marijuana companies and to assess the compliance of these posts with WAC regulations., Design, Setting, and Participants: In a cross-sectional study, a content analysis of 1027 social media posts was conducted to identify and assess compliance of WAC regulations with the business pages of recreational marijuana companies located on Facebook and Twitter platforms in the state of Washington from December 1, 2015, through November 30, 2016., Main Outcomes and Measures: Application of coding based on WAC regulations to focus on the prohibition of language that promoted the overconsumption of marijuana, that described its curative or therapeutic benefits, or that was designed to appeal to youths; and the requirements for warnings about intoxication, driving, health risks, and age restrictions for marijuana., Results: Of the 1027 posts on Facebook and Twitter from business pages of 6 marijuana companies, Facebook followers ranged from 342 to 1592 persons and Twitter followers ranged from 374 to 2915 persons per company. Findings for WAC regulations included 17 posts (1.7%) that encouraged overconsumption; 137 posts (13.3%) that promoted therapeutic benefits; and 9 posts (0.01%) that appealed to youths. Requirements for warnings addressing intoxication, driving, health risks, and age restrictions were present on 110 posts (10.7%). Some businesses repeatedly violated particular regulations; 7 of 17 (41.2%) posts encouraging overconsumption derived from 1 marijuana company., Conclusions and Relevance: Most social media posts by marijuana companies were consistent with WAC regulations that prohibit particular messages, but few companies provided required warning messages. Findings can be used toward implementation strategies for marijuana prevention to address these influential media messages.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Egan, Kathleen L</author><author>Suerken, Cynthia</author><author>Debinski, Beata</author><author>Reboussin, Beth A</author><author>Wagoner, Kimberly G</author><author>Sutfin, Erin L</author><author>Wolfson, Mark</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>More than just Alcohol: Marijuana and Illicit Drug Use at Parties Attended by 15-20 Year Olds.</title><secondary-title>Substance use &amp; misuse</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Substance use &amp; misuse</full-title></periodical><pages>1-10</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2018.1517798</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30395766</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Parties are a common setting for marijuana and illicit drug use among adolescents., OBJECTIVES: This study examined the context of parties with alcohol, marijuana and illicit drug use attended by adolescents and young adults., METHODS: In 2016, an address-based sample of 1,764 15-20-year-olds in 24 U.S. communities participated in an online survey. Parties were categorized as alcohol-only (Alc-only), marijuana + alcohol (Mj + Alc), and illicit + marijuana + alcohol (ID + Mj + Alc) based on survey participants' observations and self-reported drug use at the last party attended. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify correlates of substance use at parties., RESULTS: 1,089 participants (61.7%) reported ever attending a party where alcohol was consumed. Of those, 60.1% reported that the last party they attended had Alc-only, 24.9% had Mj + Alc, and 10.0% had ID + Mj + Alc. Older participants were more likely to attend a party with Mj + Alc or ID + Mj + Alc. Participants whose mother had a college degree (compared to less than a college degree) were less likely to attend a party with ID + Mj + Alc. Parties with Mj + Alc and ID + Mj + Alc were larger and the majority of attendees were under 21. Parties with ID + Mj + Alc were more likely to be majority female compared to mixed gender. Parties with Mj + Alc were more likely to occur at someone else's home and be in states where medical and recreational marijuana use was legal., CONCLUSION: One-third of parties attended by 15-20-year-olds had marijuana and/or illicit drug use in addition to alcohol consumption. The identified risk factors of parties with marijuana and illicit drug use can be used to develop targeted prevention strategies.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haines-Saah, Rebecca J</author><author>Jenkins, Emily K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Setting the Legal Age for Access to Cannabis in Canada: Bridging Neuroscience, Policy, and Prevention.</title><secondary-title>Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology</full-title></periodical><pages>213-214</pages><volume>43</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npp.2017.234</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29192661</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Richins, Richard D</author><author>Rodriguez-Uribe, Laura</author><author>Lowe, Kiah</author><author>Ferral, Rebekah</author><author>O'Connell, Mary A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accumulation of bioactive metabolites in cultivated medical Cannabis.</title><secondary-title>PloS one</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PloS one</full-title></periodical><pages>e0201119</pages><volume>13</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0201119</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30036388</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>There has been an increased use of medical Cannabis in the United States of America as more states legalize its use. Complete chemical analyses of this material can vary considerably between producers and is often not fully provided to consumers. As phytochemists in a state with legal medical Cannabis we sought to characterize the accumulation of phytochemicals in material grown by licensed commercial producers. We report the development of a simple extraction and analysis method, amenable to use by commercial laboratories for the detection and quantification of both cannabinoids and terpenoids. Through analysis of developing flowers on plants, we can identify sources of variability of floral metabolites due to flower maturity and position on the plant. The terpenoid composition varied by accession and was used to cluster cannabis strains into specific types. Inclusion of terpenoids with cannabinoids in the analysis of medical cannabis should be encouraged, as both of these classes of compounds could play a role in the beneficial medical effects of different cannabis strains.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hernandez-Cervantes, Rosalia</author><author>Mendez-Diaz, Monica</author><author>Prospero-Garcia, Oscar</author><author>Morales-Montor, Jorge</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Immunoregulatory Role of Cannabinoids during Infectious Disease.</title><secondary-title>Neuroimmunomodulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Neuroimmunomodulation</full-title></periodical><pages>183-199</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4-5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>Switzerland</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1159/000481824</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29151103</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Although the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is involved in the regulation of several physiological processes, including sleep and the immune response, its role during infections has not been fully studied. It is well known that the use of this drug increases susceptibility to infections because of the impact on the modulation of the immune system. Concerning the medicinal or recreational use of marijuana, its influence on the course of an infection, whether this has been caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, and to a lesser degree, fungi, has been reported. Furthermore, there is evidence suggesting the involvement of the ECS in the control and elimination of infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, and some protozoa; in the case of fungi, few studies are available so far. The purpose of this review is to present the existing studies related to infections and the ECS, the microbicidal effects of compounds isolated from Cannabis sativa, and the association between marijuana use and the development of rare pathologies in specific diseases.Copyright © 2017 S.

In most cases these are synthetic drugs first synthesized in academic or pharmaceutical laboratories for research or drug development purposes, but also include naturally occurring substances that do not fit the typical pharmacological or behavioral profile of traditional illicit substances. Perhaps most unique to this generation of new drugs is that they are being sold over the counter and on the Internet as &quot;legal highs&quot; or substitutes for traditional illicit drugs such as cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, MDMA, and LSD. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of novel drugs in current use, including the epidemiology of use and toxicologic and pharmacological properties, and to offer some guidelines to clinicians who see patients experiencing adverse effects from these drugs., METHOD: We review the known scientific literature on recently introduced synthetic drug types, synthetic cannabinoids and synthetic cathinones, and the hallucinogen Salvia divinorum., RESULTS: These substances comprise part of a rapidly evolving and controversial drug market that has challenged definitions of what is legal and illegal, has benefitted from open commercial sales without regulatory oversight, and is noteworthy for the pace at which new substances are introduced., CONCLUSIONS: This emerging trend in substance use presents significant and unique public health and criminal justice challenges. At this time, these substances are not detected in routine drug screens and substance-specific treatment for cases of use-related toxicity are not available. Clinicians are encouraged to learn characteristic signs associated with misuse of novel drugs to recognize cases in their practice, and are recommended to use a symptom-specific approach for treatment in each case.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>D'Souza, Deepak Cyril</author><author>Cortes-Briones, Jose A</author><author>Ranganathan, Mohini</author><author>Thurnauer, Halle</author><author>Creatura, Gina</author><author>Surti, Toral</author><author>Planeta, Beata</author><author>Neumeister, Alexander</author><author>Pittman, Brian</author><author>Normandin, Marc</author><author>Kapinos, Michael</author><author>Ropchan, Jim</author><author>Huang, Yiyun</author><author>Carson, Richard E</author><author>Skosnik, Patrick D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rapid Changes in CB1 Receptor Availability in Cannabis Dependent Males after Abstinence from Cannabis.</title><secondary-title>Biological psychiatry.

Exposure to cannabinoids is known to result in CB1R downregulation. However, the precise time course of changes in CB1R availability in cannabis dependent subjects (CDs) following short and intermediate term abstinence has not been determined., METHODS: Using High Resolution Research Tomography (HRRT) and [11C]OMAR, CB1R availability as indexed by the volume of distribution (VT) [11C]OMAR was measured in male CDs (n=11) and matched healthy controls (HCs) (n=19). CDs were scanned at baseline (while they were neither intoxicated nor in withdrawal), and after 2 days and 28 days of monitored abstinence. HCs were scanned at baseline and a subset (n=4) was rescanned 28 days later., RESULTS: Compared to HCs, [11C]OMAR VT was 15% lower in CDs (effect size Cohen's d=-1.11) at baseline in almost all brain regions. However, these group differences in CB1R availability were no longer evident after just 2 days of monitored abstinence from cannabis. There was a robust negative correlation between CB1R availability and withdrawal symptoms after 2 days of abstinence. Finally, there were no significant group differences in CB1R availability in CDs after 28 days of abstinence., CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis dependence is associated with CB1R downregulation, which begins to reverse surprisingly rapidly upon termination of cannabis use and may continue to increase over time.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peters, Erica N</author><author>Bae, Dayoung</author><author>Barrington-Trimis, Jessica L</author><author>Jarvis, Brantley P</author><author>Leventhal, Adam M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and Sociodemographic Correlates of Adolescent Use and Polyuse of Combustible, Vaporized, and Edible Cannabis Products.</title><secondary-title>JAMA network open</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JAMA network open</full-title></periodical><pages>e182765</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2018.2765</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30646180</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Importance: Cannabis legalization and commercialization have introduced novel alternative cannabis products, including edible and vaporized cannabis that might appeal to youth and be associated with polyuse (ie, use of &gt;=2 different products)., Objective: To investigate the prevalence, patterns, and sociodemographic correlates of cannabis product use across combustible, edible, and vaporized administration methods, including polyuse of cannabis via multiple administration methods., Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional survey study included 10th-grade students from 10 Los Angeles, California, area high schools from January 2 through October 6, 2015. Students were recruited from respondents in the Happiness and Health Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study in the 10 high schools. Students not in school during administration of the pencil-and-paper survey completed abbreviated surveys by telephone, internet, or mail. Data were analyzed from July 17, 2017, through July 12, 2018., Exposures: Self-reported sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). Students with high SES had parents who attained college or a higher educational level and were ineligible for free or subsidized lunch; those with low SES had parents with lower educational attainment or were eligible for free or subsidized lunch., Main Outcomes and Measures: Self-report of ever use (yes or no) and past 30-day use (yes or no) status and frequency of use (days in past 30 days) of combustible, edible, and vaporized cannabis., Results: The sample included 3177 tenth-grade students (93.5% of study enrollees); among these students, 1715 (54.0%) were girls and the mean (SD) age was 16.1 (0.4) years. Among those with available demographic data, respondents were diverse in race/ethnicity (537 [17.2%] Asian; 149 [4.8%] black; 1510 [48.3%] Hispanic; 507 [16.2%] white; 207 [6.6%] multiethnic/multiracial; and 216 [6.9%] other) and included 1654 (60.1%) with a low SES. Prevalence of ever use was highest for combustible products (993 [31.3%]), followed by edible (676 [21.3%]) and vaporized (333 [10.5%]) products. A similar pattern was found for past 30-day use (426 [13.4%] for combustible, 249 [7.8%] for edible, and 156 [4.9%] for vaporized cannabis). Among participants who reported using cannabis in the past 30 days, mean frequency of use of combustible cannabis was higher by 2.65 days (95% CI, 1.40-3.91 days, P = .001) than the mean frequency of use for edible cannabis and 1.75 days higher (95% CI, 0.59-2.90 days, P = .003) than frequency of use for vaporized cannabis. Most cannabis users (665 [61.7%]) used multiple administration methods, and 260 (8.2%) used all 3 methods. Boys had higher prevalence of ever use for vaporized (170 [11.6%] vs 163 [9.5%]) but not combustible (459 [31.4%] vs 534 [31.1%]) or edible (303 [20.7%] vs 373 [21.7%]) cannabis. Respondents with low SES had higher prevalence of ever use for combustible (614 [37.1%] vs 242 [22.0%]) and edible (408 [24.7%] vs 166 [15.1%]) but not vaporized (186 [11.2%] vs 93 [8.5%]) cannabis., Conclusions and Relevance: Among 10th-grade students in Los Angeles, use of cannabis via alternative administration methods was of appreciable prevalence, predominately reported in conjunction with other cannabis products and unequally distributed across sociodemographic strata. Prevention programs and regulatory restrictions addressing the spectrum of cannabis products might benefit pediatric public health.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krystal, Hannah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Misclassification of Medical Marijuana.</title><secondary-title>The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law</full-title></periodical><pages>472-479</pages><volume>46</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.29158/JAAPL.003790-18</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30593477</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Marijuana has a complicated legal, social, and economic history in the United States, as well as an uncertain future. Marijuana has been consistently tied to racial minority groups since its arrival in the United States in the 1900s, and former Attorney General Jeff Sessions further propagated that notion. AG Sessions even recently wrote a memo that directly contradicted Obama-era policy, demonstrating that the current legal status of marijuana in both state and federal government is currently up for debate. While several states have legalized marijuana for medical or even recreational purposes, federal law still categorizes cannabis as a drug with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. The comparison between marijuana, opioids, and ketamine in this article demonstrates that marijuana has been unnecessarily withheld and stigmatized by the federal government. Also reviewed is the impact of stringent marijuana-based legal policies upon the racial makeup of prison populations. The implications of current policy upon potential and future research are also discussed, with the determination that current policy has stymied research and prevented a more accurate determination of the risks and benefits of medical marijuana.Copyright © 2018 American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tarragon, Ernesto</author><author>Moreno, Juan Jose</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cannabinoids, Chemical Senses, and Regulation of Feeding Behavior.</title><secondary-title>Chemical senses</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical senses</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjy068</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30481264</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The herb Cannabis sativa has been traditionally used in many cultures and all over the world for thousands of years as medicine and recreation. However, because it was brought to the Western world in the late 19th century, its use has been a source of controversy with respect to its physiological effects as well as the generation of specific behaviors. In this regard, the CB1 receptor represents the most relevant target molecule of cannabinoid components on nervous system and whole-body energy homeostasis. Thus, the promotion of CB1 signaling can increase appetite and stimulate feeding, whereas blockade of CB1 suppresses hunger and induces hypophagia. Taste and flavor are sensory experiences involving the oral perception of food-derived chemicals and drive a primal sense of acceptable or unacceptable for what is sampled. Therefore, research within the last decades focused on deciphering the effect of cannabinoids on the chemical senses involved in food perception and consequently in the pattern of feeding. In this review, we summarize the data on the effect of cannabinoids on chemical senses and their influences on food intake control and feeding behavior.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tai, Sherrica</author><author>Fantegrossi, William E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synthetic Cannabinoids: Pharmacology, Behavioral Effects, and Abuse Potential.</title><secondary-title>Current addiction reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Current addiction reports</full-title></periodical><pages>129-136</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2014</year></dates><pub-location>Switzerland</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=26413452</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cannabis has been used throughout the world for centuries. The psychoactive effects of cannabis are largely attributable to DELTA9-tetrahydrocannabinol (DELTA9-THC), the prototypical cannabinoid that occurs naturally in the plant. More recently, chemically- and pharmacologically-distinct synthetic cannabinoids (SCBs) have emerged as drugs of abuse. As compared to DELTA9-THC, the distinct structures of these compounds allow them to avoid legal restrictions (at least initially) and detection in standard drug screens. This has contributed to the popularity of SCBs among drug users who seek to avoid positive drug screens. Importantly, the distinct structures of the SCBs also typically result in increased affinity for and efficacy at cannabinoid CB1 receptors, which are thought to be responsible for the psychoactive effects of DELTA9-THC and its analogues. Accordingly, it seems likely that these more powerful cannabimimetic effects could result in increased adverse reactions and toxicities not elicited by DELTA9-THC in cannabis. Animal models useful for the study of emerging SCBs include the cannabinoid tetrad, drug discrimination, and assays of tolerance, dependence, and withdrawal. However, these in vivo procedures have not been particularly informative with regards to drug efficacy, where the majority of SCB effects are comparable to those of DELTA9-THC. In contrast, essentially all in vitro measures of drug efficacy confirm DELTA9-THC as a relatively weak CB1 partial agonist, while the majority of the SCBs detected in commercial preparations are full agonists at the CB1 receptor. As use of these emerging SCBs continues to rise, there is an urgent need to better understand the pharmacology and toxicology of these novel compounds.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bigand, Teresa</author><author>Anderson, Cristina Lee</author><author>Roberts, Mary Lee</author><author>Shaw, Michele Rose</author><author>Wilson, Marian</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Benefits and adverse effects of cannabis use among adults with persistent pain.</title><secondary-title>Nursing outlook</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nursing outlook</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.outlook.2018.12.014</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30616866</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Increasingly, states are legalizing cannabis for recreational use. Improved accessibility may allow adults with pain to use cannabis more liberally. Greater understanding is needed about how adults with pain perceive the effects of cannabis, particularly those who also use opioid analgesics., PURPOSE: To examine the perceived effects of cannabis among adults who have been prescribed opioids for persistent pain., METHODS: A survey-based study was conducted on 150 adults with persistent pain. Data from two open-ended questions were analyzed using a qualitative descriptive approach and content analysis., FINDINGS: Data analysis led to identification of two main categories and five subcategories: (a) cannabis benefits with two subcategories of &quot;physiological&quot; and &quot;mental health&quot;; (b) adverse effects with three subcategories of &quot;physiological,&quot; &quot;mental health,&quot; and &quot;social and economic concerns.&quot;, DISCUSSION: Both positive and negative effects of cannabis were described.

We examined characteristics of patients with healthcare encounters possibly related to cannabis and assessed the temporal association between legalization of recreational marijuana and healthcare encounters possibly attributed to cannabis., METHODS: Annual encounter rates possibly related to cannabis and alcohol were compared using negative binomial regression. Two-time intervals, pre/post-recreational marijuana legalization (January 2009 to December 2013 and January 2014 to December 2015, respectively) were used to examine changes in monthly rates of emergency encounters and hospitalizations possibly related to cannabis. Level and trend changes on encounter rates by legalization period were assessed using interrupted time series analyses. Encounters possibly related to alcohol were used as a comparator group., RESULTS: Most encounters identified during the study period had alcohol-related International Classification of Diseases Diagnosis and Procedural Codes (ICD-9/10-CM) codes (94.8% vs 5.2% for cannabis). Patients with encounters possibly related to cannabis were younger, more likely to be hospitalized and more likely to be admitted to the psychiatric unit than patients with encounters possibly related to alcohol. Initial and sustained effects of encounter rates possibly related to cannabis demonstrated an increased trend in slope before and after recreational marijuana legalization. The slope became more abrupt following legalization with a significant increase in trend during the post-legalization period (beta = 2.7, standard error = 0.3, rho &lt; 0.0001). No significant change was noted for encounters possibly related to alcohol., CONCLUSIONS: Additional research should identify patients at highest risk of an adverse health event related to cannabis and quantify costs associated with cannabis-related healthcare delivery.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orr, Catherine</author><author>Spechler, Philip</author><author>Cao, Zhipeng</author><author>Albaugh, Matthew</author><author>Chaarani, Bader</author><author>Mackey, Scott</author><author>D'Souza, Deepak</author><author>Allgaier, Nicholas</author><author>Banaschewski, Tobias</author><author>Bokde, Arun L W</author><author>Bromberg, Uli</author><author>Buchel, Christian</author><author>Burke Quinlan, Erin</author><author>Conrod, Patricia</author><author>Desrivieres, Sylvane</author><author>Flor, Herta</author><author>Frouin, Vincent</author><author>Gowland, Penny</author><author>Heinz, Andreas</author><author>Ittermann, Bernd</author><author>Martinot, Jean-Luc</author><author>Paillere Martinot, Marie-Laure</author><author>Nees, Frauke</author><author>Papadopoulos Orfanos, Dimitri</author><author>Paus, Tomas</author><author>Poustka, Luise</author><author>Millenet, Sabina</author><author>Frohner, Juliane H</author><author>Radhakrishnan, Rajiv</author><author>Smolka, Michael N</author><author>Walter, Henrik</author><author>Whelan, Robert</author><author>Schumann, Gunter</author><author>Potter, Alexandra</author><author>Garavan, Hugh</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Grey Matter Volume Differences Associated with Extremely Low Levels of Cannabis Use in Adolescence.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3375-17.2018</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30643026</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Rates of cannabis use among adolescents are high, and are increasing concurrent with changes in the legal status of marijuana and societal attitudes regarding its use. Recreational cannabis use is understudied, especially in the adolescent period when neural maturation may make users particularly vulnerable to the effects of DELTA-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on brain structure. In the current study, we used voxel-based morphometry to compare grey matter volume (GMV) in 46 fourteen year old human adolescents (males and females) with just one or two instances of cannabis use and carefully matched THC-naive controls. We identified extensive regions in the bilateral medial temporal lobes as well as the bilateral posterior cingulate, lingual gyri, and cerebellum that showed greater GMV in the cannabis users. Analysis of longitudinal data confirmed that GMV differences were unlikely to precede cannabis use. GMV in the temporal regions was associated with contemporaneous performance on the Perceptual Reasoning Index and with future generalized anxiety symptoms in the cannabis users. The distribution of GMV effects mapped onto biomarkers of the endogenous cannabinoid system providing insight into possible mechanisms for these effects.Significance StatementAlmost 35% of American 10th graders have reported using cannabis and existing research suggests that initiation of cannabis use in adolescence is associated with long-term neurocognitive effects. We understand very little about the earliest effects of cannabis use, however, as most research is conducted in adults with a heavy pattern of lifetime use. This study presents evidence suggesting structural brain and cognitive effects of just one or two instances of cannabis use in adolescence. Converging evidence suggests a role for the endocannabinoid system in these effects. This research is particularly timely as the legal status of cannabis is changing in many jurisdictions and the perceived risk by youth associated with smoking cannabis has declined in recent years.Copyright © 2019 the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bardhi, Flutura</author><author>Sifaneck, Stephen J</author><author>Johnson, Bruce D</author><author>Dunlap, Eloise</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pills, Thrills and Bellyaches: Case Studies of Prescription Pill Use and Misuse among Marijuana/Blunt Smoking Middle Class Young Women.</title><secondary-title>Contemporary drug problems</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Contemporary drug problems</full-title></periodical><pages>53-101</pages><volume>34</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2007</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=19081798</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Recent survey research has documented important increases during the 2000s in the misuse and abuse of several prescription drugs (Vicodin, Percocet, Codeine, Dilaudid, Xanax, Klonopin, Valium, Ativan, Adderall, Ritalin, among others). This article focuses upon the patterns of pill use and misuse among young women who are middle-class white and college-educated, and they are also experienced marijuana users who report recreational consumption of other illegal drugs. The ethnographic data provides insights about various ways and reasons that such prescription pill misuse occurs among 12 college-educated, (upper) middle-class, white/Asian women in their 20s who were involved in a major ethnographic study of marijuana and blunts. Three patterns of pill use were observed: recreational; quasi-medical; and legal medical; shifts among these patterns of pill use was common. Few reported that their pill use interfered with their conventional jobs and lifestyles; they concealed such use from their employers and coworkers, and from non-using friends and family members. None reported contacts with police nor seeking treatment specifically for their pill misuse. Many reported misusing prescription pills in conjunction with illegal drugs (marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy) and alcohol. Pills were used as a way to enhance the euphoric effects of other drugs, as well as a way to avoid the negative side effects of illegal drugs. Some reported pill use as a means for reducing expenditures (and use of) alcohol and cocaine. The implications suggest a hidden subpopulation of prescription pill misusers among regular users of marijuana and other illegal drugs. Future research should include users and misusers of various pills to better understand how prescriptions pills interact with illegal drug use patterns.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reed, Stephanie C</author><author>Haney, Margaret</author><author>Manubay, Jeanne</author><author>Campagna, Bianca R</author><author>Reed, Brian</author><author>Foltin, Richard W</author><author>Evans, Suzette M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sex differences in stress reactivity after intranasal oxytocin in recreational cannabis users.</title><secondary-title>Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior</full-title></periodical><pages>72-82</pages><volume>176</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2018.11.008</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30521833</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Cannabis is the most widely used illicit drugs and the changing legal, political and cultural climate will likely increase cannabis use further. One factor that may underlie the transition from recreational use to problematic use is stress. The hormone oxytocin (OXT) modulates stress and may have therapeutic efficacy for substance use disorders, but few studies have examined OXT in cannabis users. Another factor is sex; although more men smoke cannabis, the transition from recreational to problematic use is faster in women. Using a within-subjects design, the effects of intranasal (i.n.) oxytocin (OXT; 40IU) administration on stress reactivity (using the Trier Social Stress Test; TSST) and cannabis (5.6% THC) self-administration was assessed in recreational cannabis using men (n=31) and women (n=32) relative to i.n. placebo (PBO) and no-stress (NST) conditions. The TSST produced expected subjective and cardiovascular effects compared to the NST. However, in the i.n. OXT-TSST condition, positive subjective effects were lower and negative subjective effects were higher in women compared to PBO administration and compared to men. Further, latency to self-administer cannabis was longer in women than men and women self-administered less cannabis than men regardless of stress condition. There were no differences in cannabis craving as a function of sex, stress, or medication. These results suggest that OXT administration may lead to greater stress reactivity in recreational cannabis users, particularly women, and support growing evidence that sex differences should be carefully considered when examining the therapeutic potential of OXT.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

With legalization of marijuana in several US states and a 1990 study in which authors documented psychomotor deficits in infants breastfed by mothers using marijuana, there is a need for information on potential exposure to the breastfed infant. Our objective with this study was to quantify cannabinoids in human milk after maternal marijuana use., METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, 50 breastfeeding women who reported marijuana use provided 54 breast milk samples to a research repository, Mommy's Milk. Concentrations of DELTA-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (9-THC), 11-hydroxy-DELTA-9-tetrahydrocannabinol, cannabidiol, and cannabinol were measured by using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry electrospray ionization., RESULTS: 9-THC was detectable in 34 (63%) of the 54 samples up to ~6 days after last reported use; the median concentration of 9-THC was 9.47 ng/mL (range: 1.01-323.00). Five samples had detectable levels of 11-hydroxy-DELTA-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (range: 1.33-12.80 ng/mL) or cannabidiol (range: 1.32-8.56 ng/mL). The sample with the highest concentration of cannabidiol (8.56 ng/mL) did not have measurable 9-THC. Cannabinol was not detected in any samples. The number of hours since last use was a significant predictor of log 9-THC concentrations (-0.03; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.04 to -0.01; P = .005). Adjusted for time since last use, the number of daily uses and time from sample collection to analysis were also significant predictors of log 9-THC concentrations (0.51; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.99; P = .039; 0.08; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.15; P = .038, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: 9-THC was measurable in a majority of breast milk samples up to ~6 days after maternal marijuana use.Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stetten, Nichole</author><author>Pomeranz, Jamie</author><author>Moorhouse, Michael</author><author>Yurasek, Ali</author><author>Blue, Amy V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The level of evidence of medical marijuana use for treating disabilities: a scoping review.</title><secondary-title>Disability and rehabilitation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Disability and rehabilitation</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2018.1523952</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30456993</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>PURPOSE: Twenty-nine states have bypassed federal regulations by legalizing marijuana (MJ) either medicinally, recreationally or both. The FDA states that there is no empirical evidence that MJ is effective to treat these disorders. With over a billion individuals living with a disability across the globe, it is crucial to fully research the efficaciousness and safety of medical MJ to treat this population. The purpose to present the results of a scoping review of studies focused on the levels of evidence currently available on medical MJ's efficacy in treatment across a large range of disabilities., METHODS: Databases were searched for research articles on the current level of evidence to support medical MJ use among people with disabilities., RESULTS: Forty-one peer reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria. Articles focused on attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, schizophrenia, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis/movement disorders, fibromyalgia, epilepsy, with some that focused on multiple disabilities., CONCLUSIONS: The level of evidence for the use of medical MJ among people with disabilities varies greatly, and has a clear lack of methodologically sound studies. Overall, medical MJ does not improve the level of functioning, but it may improve the overall quality of life for people with disabilities. Implications for Rehabilitation Epilepsy can be a disabling chronic disorder which not only impacts physically but can restricts quality of life. Quality of life is diminished even more with treatment resistant epilepsy. Chronic pain is the leading cause of disability and is the most common cause of long-term disability. There is sufficient evidence that medical marijuana is effective in treating epileptic seizures and chronic pain. Medical marijuana may improve the level of functioning and quality of life for individuals with certain disabilities.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manolis, Theodora A</author><author>Manolis, Antonis A</author><author>Manolis, Antonis S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cannabis Associated &quot;High&quot; Cardiovascular Morbidity and Mortality: Marijuana Smoke Like Tobacco Smoke?

Thus, concerns have risen about potential adverse health effects. Increasing number of reports have associated cannabis use with serious cardiovascular (CV) complications. Furthermore, there appears to be a likeness in the harmful health effects, especially on the CV and respiratory systems, of cannabis smoking to those of tobacco smoking., OBJECTIVE: to review the CV effects of cannabis use and compare them with those of tobacco use., METHODS: Articles were reviewed that were published in the English literature reporting on cannabis and cannabinoid pharmacology and their effects on the CV system and their attendant consequences. Emphasis was also placed on articles reporting on cannabis use in adolescents, exposure to secondhand smoke, its effect on exercise and finally its inter-relationship and similarities with tobacco use., RESULTS: With growing cannabis use, increasing number of reports have emerged associating marijuana use with serious and life-threatening CV complications, including acute coronary syndromes, potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmias and ischemic strokes. There are certain similarities of the deleterious CV and respiratory effects of cannabis smoking with those of tobacco smoking. Despite the difference in the active ingredients (tetrahydrocannabinol vs nicotine), each substance produces a plethora of chemicals when smoked and these are largely identical; furthermore, due to different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for a longer time. Of course, concomitant tobacco and cannabis smoking is a perplexing factor in isolating damages specifically pertaining to cannabis use, while the health risk is additive. Although the mechanisms producing CV harm may be somewhat different between these two substances, the outcome appears similar, or even worse, as the effects may emerge at a younger age., CONCLUSION: There is an increasing concern that, apart from the mental health problem with cannabis smoking, societies may be facing another wave of a deja vu / deja vecu phenomenon similar to the tobacco smoking story.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.org.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Levi, M E</author><author>Montague, B T</author><author>Thurstone, C</author><author>Kumar, D</author><author>Huprikar, S S</author><author>Kotton, C N</author><author>Transplantation, Executive Committee of the Infectious Diseases Community of Practice of the American Society of</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Marijuana Use in Transplantation: A Call for Clarity.</title><secondary-title>Clinical transplantation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Clinical transplantation</full-title></periodical><pages>e13456</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>Denmark</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ctr.13456</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30506888</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Transplant centers have varying policies for marijuana (MJ) use in donors, transplant candidates and recipients. Rationales for these differences range from concerns for fungal complications, impaired adherence and drug interactions. This paper reviews the current status of MJ policies and practices in transplant centers and results of a survey sent to the American Society of Transplantation (AST) membership by the Executive Committee of the AST Infectious Diseases Community of Practice. The purpose of the survey was to compare policies and concerns of MJ use to actual observed complications. Of the 3,321 surveys sent, 225 members (8%) responded. Transplant centers varied in their approval processes, differing even in organ types within the same institutions. Furthermore, there was discordance among transplant centers in their perceived risks of marijuana use as opposed to complications actually observed. An increasing number of states continue to legalize medical and recreational MJ resulting in widespread availability. Further research is needed to assess the validity of concerns for complications of MJ use in potential donors and recipients. Ultimately, standardized guidelines should be established based on studies and evidence based criteria to assist transplant programs in their policies around the use of cannabis in their donors and recipients.

Yet, little is known about these interactions and how the characteristics of budtenders affect these interactions. This study investigated demographics, workplace characteristics, medical decision-making, and online behaviors among a sample of budtenders., METHODS: Between June and September 2016, a cross-sectional Internet survey was administered to budtenders in the San Francisco Bay Area and Greater Los Angeles. A total of 158 budtenders fully responded to the survey. A series of comparisons were conducted to determine differences between trained and untrained budtenders., RESULTS: Among the 158 budtenders, 56% had received formal training to become a budtender. Several demographic differences were found between trained and untrained budtenders. For workplace characteristics, trained budtenders were more likely to report budtender as their primary job (74% vs 53%), practice more than 5 years (34% vs 11%), and receive sales commission (57% vs 16%). Trained budtenders were significantly less likely to perceive medical decision-making as very important (47% vs 68%) and have a patient-centered philosophy (77% vs 89%). Although trained budtenders had significantly lower Internet usage, they were significantly more likely to exchange information with patients through e-mail (58% vs 39%), text message (46% vs 30%), mobile app (33% vs 11%), video call (26% vs 3%), and social media (51% vs 23%)., CONCLUSIONS: Budtenders who are formally trained exhibit significantly different patterns of interaction with medical cannabis patients. Future studies will use multivariate methods to better determine which factors independently influence interactions and how budtenders operate after the introduction of regulations under the newly passed Proposition 64 that permits recreational cannabis use in California.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Celius, Elisabeth G</author><author>Vila, Carlos</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The influence of THC:CBD oromucosal spray on driving ability in patients with multiple sclerosis-related spasticity.</title><secondary-title>Brain and behavior</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brain and behavior</full-title></periodical><pages>e00962</pages><volume>8</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1002/brb3.962</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29761015</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Driving ability is a key function for the majority of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) to help maintain daily interactions. Both physical and cognitive disability, as well as treatments, may affect the ability to drive. Spasticity is a common symptom associated with MS, and it may affect driving performance either directly or via the medications used to treat it. In this article, we review the evidence relating the antispasticity medicine, DELTA9-tetrahydrocannabinol:cannabidiol (THC:CBD) oromucosal spray (Sativex), and its potential impact on driving performance., Methods: Articles were identified by searching PubMed from 1/1/2000 to 30/6/2017 using a specified list of search terms. The articles identified using these search terms were augmented with relevant references from these papers and other articles known to the authors., Results: The results from THC:CBD oromucosal spray driving studies and real-world registries did not show any evidence of an increase in motor vehicle accidents associated with THC:CBD oromucosal spray. The majority of patients reported an improvement in driving ability after starting THC:CBD oromucosal spray, and it was speculated that this may be related to reduced spasticity and/or better cognitive function. It should be noted that THC blood levels are significantly lower than the levels associated with recreational use of herbal cannabis., Conclusions: THC:CBD oromucosal spray was shown not to impair driving performance. However, periodic assessment of patients with MS driving ability is recommended, especially after relapses and changes in treatment. Blood THC measurements might be above authorized thresholds for some countries following administration of THC:CBD oromucosal spray, thus specific knowledge of each country's driving regulations and a medical certificate are recommended.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Treister-Goltzman, Yulia</author><author>Freud, Tamar</author><author>Press, Yan</author><author>Peleg, Roni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends in Publications on Medical Cannabis from the Year 2000.</title><secondary-title>Population health management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Population health management</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/pop.2018.0113</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30300079</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Widespread use of cannabis as a drug and passage of legislation on its use should lead to an increase in the number of scientific publications on cannabis. The aim of this study was to compare trends in scientific publication for papers on medical cannabis, papers on cannabis in general, and all papers between the years 2000 and 2017. A search of PubMed and Web of Science was conducted. The overall number of scientific publications in PubMed increased 2.5-fold. In contrast, the number of publications on cannabis increased 4.5-fold and the number of publications on medical cannabis increased almost 9-fold. The number of publications on medical cannabis in Web of science increased even more (10-fold). The most significant number of publications was in the field of psychiatry. In the fields of neurology and cancer treatment there was a significant increase in the years 2011-2013. There was a rise in the number of publications on children and the elderly after 2013. The specific indications with the largest number of publications were HIV (261), chronic pain (179), multiple sclerosis (118), nausea and vomiting (102), and epilepsy (88). More than half of the publications on medical cannabis originated from the United States, followed by Canada. More than 66% of the publications were original studies. The spike in the number of scientific publications on medical cannabis since 2013 is encouraging. In light of this trend the authors expect an even greater increase in the number of publications in this area in coming years.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cavazos-Rehg, Patricia A</author><author>Krauss, Melissa J</author><author>Sowles, Shaina J</author><author>Murphy, Gabrielle M</author><author>Bierut, Laura J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exposure to and Content of Marijuana Product Reviews.</title><secondary-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research</full-title></periodical><pages>127-137</pages><volume>19</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11121-017-0818-9</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=28681195</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Many individuals now seek out product reviews in order to make an informed decision prior to making a purchase. In this study, we investigate consumers' exposure to and content within product reviews about marijuana because of their potential to shape marijuana purchasing decisions. The terms &quot;weed review,&quot; &quot;marijuana review,&quot; and &quot;cannabis review&quot; were searched on YouTube on June 10-11, 2015; the team viewed and coded the content of 83 product review videos about marijuana. In addition, we surveyed young adult (18-34 years old) current (past month) marijuana users (n = 742) from across the USA online to assess exposure to product reviews about marijuana and associations with socio-demographic characteristics and marijuana use behaviors. In our content analysis of videos, we observed that the reviewers tended to consume marijuana during the video and often shared personal, favorable experiences towards the marijuana they ingested (e.g., became as high as possible or experienced positive effects on physical and mental health). Most videos normalized marijuana use and could be easily accessed by underage youth. About one third (34%) of the survey participants viewed/sought a product review about marijuana in the past 30 days. In a multivariable logistic regression model, living in a state where recreational use is legal or using multiple forms of marijuana was associated with increased odds of viewing/seeking marijuana reviews. Prevention messages should counter product reviews about marijuana that tend to normalize and promote marijuana use given that they are more readily viewed by individuals who are increasingly susceptible to marijuana's potential harms.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zuckermann, Alexandra M E</author><author>Gohari, Mahmood R</author><author>de Groh, Margaret</author><author>Jiang, Ying</author><author>Leatherdale, Scott T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factors associated with cannabis use change in youth: Evidence from the COMPASS study.</title><secondary-title>Addictive behaviors</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Addictive behaviors</full-title></periodical><pages>158-163</pages><volume>90</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.addbeh.2018.10.048</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30399514</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>INTRODUCTION: Harmful effects of cannabis use in youth scale with frequency. In the context of approaching legalization in Canada, understanding the distinctions between youth who change and who maintain their cannabis use is essential for designing interventions and policy. A substantial number of characteristics may play a role. This study assessed whether and how youth who change their cannabis use differ from those who do not., METHODS: Cannabis use was reported by 8375 Canadian high school students participating in the COMPASS study. GEE multiple logistic regressions were then used to establish impact of 13 baseline demographic and behavioural exposure variables on the likelihood of membership in four frequency change groups at follow-up a year later: reduction, cessation, escalation, and maintenance., RESULTS: Groups were found to differ in several ways. Cessation group members (19.4% of users) were less likely to binge drink (OR 0.82), vape (OR 0.82), or attend class without completing homework (OR 0.72) than maintainers. Students who reduced their use (14.6% of users) were more likely to binge drink (OR 1.36), smoke (OR 1.20), and skip class (OR 1.21). Those who escalated (29.5% of users) were more likely to be male (OR 1.35) and to vape (OR 1.22)., CONCLUSIONS: Students who change their cannabis use differ in several demographic and behavioural characteristics. The results raise further concerns about the impact of e-cigarettes and the role of poly-substance use in high-risk trajectories. Distinct classes of cannabis users, essential for policy and intervention development, can be identified in high school populations.Crown Copyright © 2018. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This pilot study is an evaluation of enforcement of marijuana laws in the first two states in the U.S. to legalize sales of recreational marijuana, Colorado and Washington, several years post legalization., METHODS: We surveyed a random sample of local law enforcement agencies in the two states (25 agencies per state). We also attempted to survey the state-level marijuana enforcement agency but only Washington responded. Surveys focused on youth marijuana use, youth access to marijuana, and impaired driving but included other topics. Chi-square tests assessed differences between states (p &lt; .05)., RESULTS: All local agencies reported underage use was somewhat or very common in their jurisdictions. Thirty percent of local agencies conducted enforcement targeting underage use/possession. Twenty percent of agencies overall conducted underage compliance checks at licensed stores, with more agencies conducting checks in Colorado (32%) than Washington (8%; p = .03). Most agencies in both states reported marijuana-impaired driving was somewhat or very common in their jurisdictions. One local agency in each state specifically targeted marijuana-impaired driving. The state-level agency in Washington reported that their agency is the one primarily responsible for enforcing marijuana retail laws and they conducted routine underage compliance checks at all licensed marijuana stores three times per year., CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that marijuana enforcement can be improved regarding sales/provision to underage youth and impaired driving in these states, particularly given that underage use and impaired driving are perceived to be common. Larger studies with additional jurisdictions and types of agencies (e.g., highway patrol) are warranted.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Currently cannabis cultivars are named using obscure and inconsistent nomenclature. Terpenoids, responsible for the aroma of cannabis, are a useful group of compounds for distinguishing cannabis cultivars with similar cannabinoid content. Methods: In this study we analyzed terpenoid content of cannabis samples obtained from a single medical cannabis dispensary in California over the course of a year. Terpenoids were quantified by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection and peak identification was confirmed with gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Quantitative data from 16 major terpenoids were analyzed using hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA), principal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Results: A total of 233 samples representing 30 cultivars were used to develop a classification scheme based on quantitative data, HCA, PCA, and OPLS-DA. Initially cultivars were divided into five major groups, which were subdivided into 13 classes based on differences in terpenoid profile. Different classification models were compared with PLS-DA and found to perform best when many representative samples of a particular class were included. Conclusion: A hierarchy of terpenoid chemotypes was observed in the data set. Some cultivars fit into distinct chemotypes, whereas others seemed to represent a continuum of chemotypes. This study has demonstrated an approach to classifying cannabis cultivars based on terpenoid profile.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Haug, Nancy A</author><author>Kieschnick, Dustin</author><author>Sottile, James E</author><author>Babson, Kimberly A</author><author>Vandrey, Ryan</author><author>Bonn-Miller, Marcel O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Training and Practices of Cannabis Dispensary Staff.</title><secondary-title>Cannabis and cannabinoid research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cannabis and cannabinoid research</full-title></periodical><pages>244-251</pages><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2016</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1089/can.2016.0024</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=28861496</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Introduction: The proliferation of cannabis dispensaries within the United States has emerged from patient demand for the legalization of cannabis as an alternative treatment for a number of conditions and symptoms. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the practices of dispensary staff with respect to recommendation of cannabis strains/concentrations for specific patient ailments. To address this limitation, the present study assessed the training and practices of cannabis dispensary staff. Materials and Methods: Medical and nonmedical dispensary staff (n=55) were recruited via e-mail and social media to complete an online survey assessing their demographic characteristics, dispensary features, patient characteristics, formal training, and cannabis recommendation practices. Results: Fifty-five percent of dispensary staff reported some formal training for their position, with 20% reporting medical/scientific training. A majority (94%) indicated that they provide specific cannabis advice to patients. In terms of strains, dispensary staff trended toward recommendations of Indica for anxiety, chronic pain, insomnia, nightmares, and Tourette's syndrome. They were more likely to recommend Indica and hybrid plants for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)/trauma and muscle spasms. In contrast, staff were less likely to recommend Indica for depression; hybrid strains were most often recommended for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In terms of cannabinoid concentrations, dispensary staff were most likely to recommend a 1:1 ratio of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC):cannabidiol (CBD) for patients suffering from anxiety, Crohn's disease, hepatitis C, and PTSD/trauma, while patients seeking appetite stimulation were most likely to be recommended THC. Staff recommended high CBD for arthritis and Alzheimer's disease and a high CBD or 1:1 ratio for ALS, epilepsy, and muscle spasms. Conclusions: Although many dispensary staff are making recommendations consistent with current evidence, some are recommending cannabis that has either not been shown effective for, or could exacerbate, a patient's condition. Findings underscore the importance of consistent, evidence-based, training of dispensary staff who provide specific recommendations for patient medical conditions.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Meehan-Atrash, Jiries</author><author>Luo, Wentai</author><author>Strongin, Robert M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toxicant Formation in Dabbing: The Terpene Story.</title><secondary-title>ACS omega</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACS omega</full-title></periodical><pages>6112-6117</pages><volume>2</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.7b01130</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=28983528</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Inhalable, noncombustible cannabis products are playing a central role in the expansion of the medical and recreational use of cannabis. In particular, the practice of &quot;dabbing&quot; with butane hash oil has emerged with great popularity in states that have legalized cannabis. Despite their growing popularity, the degradation product profiles of these new products have not been extensively investigated. The study herein focuses on the chemistry of myrcene and other common terpenes found in cannabis extracts. Methacrolein, benzene, and several other products of concern to human health were formed under the conditions that simulated real-world dabbing.

As of this writing, there are approximately 10 classes of drugs approved for use in the management of pain in the United States and Canada. Recent additions to the pharmacopoeia for pain exemplify two significantly differing pathways for bringing new pain therapies to market. On the one hand, there are drugs that have been in clinical use for some time for other indications, which have been shown to have analgesic efficacy and subsequently have obtained additional label indications for the treatment of pain. Examples in this category include the alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonist clonidine (launched as an antihypertensive in 1966; gained approval for epidural use in the treatment of cancer pain 1996), and the anticonvulsant gabapentin (launched as an anticonvulsant 1994; gained approval for neuropathic pain in 2002). A number of additional marketed drugs have repeatedly demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in pain states in controlled studies but lack specific label approval for this indication. For example, randomized, controlled studies have demonstrated the utility of older tricyclic antidepressants including amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and desipramine in chronic pain states; due to the preponderance of supportive evidence these drugs are considered useful pain therapeutics. Ongoing advances in the understanding of pain mechanisms continue to reveal opportunities for the creative use of drugs of known pharmacology. In addition, many older, marketed drugs reveal a surprising richness of pharmacology when studied using new methods. Due to their potential for benefit, and also due in no small part to the lengthy and complex process required for the development and regulatory approval of novel drugs, there are many obvious advantages to the study of approved medications for the treatment of pain. The ability to conduct clinical trials with a substance that is already approved for use in humans provides for immediate testing of a hypothesis. Furthermore, since approved drugs have by definition already amassed the requisite preclinical and clinical safety data, positive results from such trials lead to a much shorter path to new regulatory approval, and thus the considerable costs of years of study involved in novel compound discovery and development are avoided. There are, however, limitations to this approach. Existing drugs may not have the ideal pharmacological or pharmacokinetic properties required. In addition, while the cost outlay of repurposing approved drugs is far less than that of inventing new ones, the retur on investment may be poor. Market protection for drugs with older patents may be limited, and from a purely business standpoint, cost analyses of investing in new research for such older drugs may be unfavorable. In addition, as safety regulation becomes more stringent, pharmaceutical companies may be reluctant to assume safety liabilities of drugs that were originally approved under less rigorous requirements. On the other hand, recent advances in research have resulted in the development of entirely novel classes of drugs, specifically developed as analgesics and brought forward with pain as an initial indication. These include COX2-selective inhibitors (celecoxib launched 1999 for pain and inflammation), the N-type calcium channel inhibitor ziconotide (launched 2005), the triptan class of serotonin receptor subtype 1B/D agonists (sumatriptan launched early 1990s), and newer cannabinoids such as Sativex, launched in Canada 2005 for the treatment of pain and spasticity due to multiple sclerosis. Because of the lengthy and complex evaluation required to bring a compound to market, the failure rate of new compounds is extremely high, as are the costs of development. The current estimate of the expenditure required to bring a new compound to market hovers near US $1 billion.1,2 Hundreds of thousands of compounds may be screened in order to identify one or two compounds that are considered suitable clinical candidates. Industry estimates are that these clinical candidates have about a 90% chance of failure during the most costly stage of evaluation, clinical trials. In general, across therapeutic areas, reasons for failure include disappointing pharmacokinetic properties in humans,3 unacceptable clinical safety profiles,4 and lack of clinical efficacy.5 Compounds may also fail to reach the marketplace due to other advances in the therapeutic field (for example, the development of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors supplanting the tricyclic antidepressants) or commercial reasons, such as the inability of a company to support an orphan drug program. Nevertheless, drug discovery for pain is an exciting, fast-paced, and rewarding field. Both the investigation of the analgesic effects of marketed drugs and the pioneering of novel drug classes are active areas of research and development: a survey of industry pipeline databases reveals more than 25 different mechanistic classes of compounds in various stages of evaluation.Copyright © 2010 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fitzcharles, Mary-Ann</author><author>Zahedi Niaki, Omid</author><author>Hauser, Winfried</author><author>Hazlewood, Glen</author><author>Association, the Canadian Rheumatology</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Position Statement: A Pragmatic Approach for Medical Cannabis and Patients with Rheumatic Diseases.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of rheumatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of rheumatology</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>Canada</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.3899/jrheum.181120</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30647183</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>OBJECTIVE: Pain is one reason some rheumatology patients may consider use of medical cannabis, a product increasingly perceived as a safe and neglected natural treatment option for many conditions. Legalization of recreational cannabis in Canada will promote access to cannabis. Physicians must therefore provide patients with the best evidence-based information regarding the medicinal effects and harm of cannabis., METHODS: The Canadian Rheumatology Association (CRA) mandated the development of a position statement for medical cannabis and the rheumatology patient. The current literature regarding the effects of medical cannabis for rheumatology patients was assessed, and a pragmatic position statement to facilitate patient care was developed by the Therapeutics Committee of the CRA and approved by the CRA board., RESULTS: There are no clinical trials of medical cannabis in rheumatology patients. Evidence is insufficient about the benefit of pharmaceutical cannabinoids in fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and back pain, but there is evidence of a high risk of harm. Extrapolating from other conditions, medical cannabis may provide some symptom relief for some patients. Short-term risks of psychomotor effects can be anticipated, but longterm risks have not been determined and are of concern., CONCLUSION: Despite lack of evidence for use of medical cannabis in rheumatology patients, we acknowledge the need to provide empathetic and pragmatic guidance for patient care. This position statement aims to facilitate the dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals in a mutually respectful manner to ensure harm reduction for patients and society.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Roppolo, Rebecca H</author><author>Brooks-Russell, Ashley</author><author>Bull, Sheana S</author><author>Maffey, Ali</author><author>Levinson, Arnold</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Legalized marijuana: Language-associated knowledge of laws and risk perceptions among Latinos.</title><secondary-title>Journal of ethnicity in substance abuse</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of ethnicity in substance abuse</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2017</year></dates><pub-location>England</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15332640.2017.1404954</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=29261477</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This study examines the extent to which knowledge of recreational marijuana laws, health effects, and perceptions of risk for marijuana use differ between Spanish- and English-speaking Latino survey respondents from a registry of Colorado adults.

Children with marijuana intoxication can have lethargy and altered mental status, often resulting in extensive workup., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify the incidence of pediatric marijuana exposure before and after marijuana legalization/commercial availability in Washington State at a tertiary care children's hospital., METHODS: Charts of patients 9 years or younger evaluated at a tertiary care pediatric hospital from October 8, 2007, to October 31, 2016, were retrospectively reviewed. Inclusion criteria were positive tetrahydrocannabinol urine toxicology screen and diagnosis consistent with unintentional marijuana exposure. Data included age, sex, exposure date range, symptoms, ancillary tests, consults, disposition, and marijuana source. Data were analyzed in R using descriptive statistics., RESULTS: Seventeen unintentional marijuana exposures were identified during our study period, 8 cases before and 9 cases after legalization of recreational marijuana, which is 1.19 events per year in the 6.75 years before legalization compared with 3.88 events per year in the 2.32 years after (P &lt; 0.05). Age range was 17 months to 7 years, with a median age of 21 months. Eighty-two percent received laboratory tests, 47% underwent head computed tomography, 6% underwent lumbar puncture, and 100% underwent social work evaluation. Thirty-five percent were discharged from the emergency department, 47% were admitted to general medicine, and 18% were admitted to the critical care unit., CONCLUSIONS: Unintentional marijuana exposure incidence increased after legalization of recreational marijuana in Washington State at a tertiary care children's hospital. Providers should be aware of this increasing incidence. These data should be considered in the drafting of future marijuana legislation.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Levene, Rachel J</author><author>Pollak-Christian, Elza</author><author>Wolfram, Sigrid</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A 21st Century Problem: Cannabis Toxicity in a 13-Month-Old Child.</title><secondary-title>The Journal of emergency medicine</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of emergency medicine</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2018</year></dates><pub-location>United States</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jemermed.2018.09.040</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30340924</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: Cannabis is one of the most abused drugs worldwide, with more than 20 million users in the United States (US). As access to cannabis products increases with expanding US legislation and decriminalization of marijuana, emergency physicians must be adept in recognizing unintentional cannabis toxicity in young children, which can range from altered mental status to encephalopathy and coma., CASE REPORT: We report the case of a 13-month-old female presenting with self-limiting altered mental status and lethargy, with a subsequent diagnosis of tetrahydrocannabinol exposure on confirmatory urine gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Considering caretakers rarely report possible cannabis exposure, history-taking must review caretakers' medicinal and recreational drug exposures to prevent inadvertently missing the diagnosis. In the young child with altered mental status, prompt urine screening for cannabinoid detection can prevent further invasive and costly diagnostic investigations, such as brain imaging and lumbar puncture.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

They include plant-derived phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids, and endogenously-derived endocannabinoids. The primary source of cannabinoid toxicity is from plant-derived cannabinoids and synthetic cannabinoids. These agents act as cannabinoid receptor agonists. More than 60 naturally occurring cannabinoids are found in the Sativa and Indica species of Cannabis, with delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) being the main psychoactive compound. Other naturally occurring cannabinoids include cannabidiol and cannabinol. Marijuana is the most common colloquial name for crushed, dried leaves and flowers of the Cannabis plant. In recent years, there have been many reports of marijuana toxicity, primarily in the pediatric population, as medical and recreational marijuana has been legalized. The terms phytocannabinoids, marijuana and cannabis are used interchangeably. Synthetic cannabinoids were created for therapeutic and research purposes; however, despite legal efforts to limit their availability, synthetic cannabinoids have become an increasingly common drug of abuse, sold under various street names such as K2, Spice, and Black Mamba. Synthetic cannabinoids are associated with much more morbidity and mortality than the phytocannabinoids. Prescription preparations for medical usage include dronabinol, or pure THC, nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, and cannabidiol (CBD). Pharmaceutical use of cannabinoids is an ongoing field of research.Copyright © 2018, StatPearls Publishing LLC.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tucker, Joan S</author><author>Rodriguez, Anthony</author><author>Pedersen, Eric R</author><author>Seelam, Rachana</author><author>Shih, Regina A</author><author>D'Amico, Elizabeth J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Greater risk for frequent marijuana use and problems among young adult marijuana users with a medical marijuana card.</title><secondary-title>Drug and alcohol dependence</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Drug and alcohol dependence</full-title></periodical><pages>178-183</pages><volume>194</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><pub-location>Ireland</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2018.09.028</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=prem&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=30447509</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: This study compared young adults with and without a medical marijuana (MM) recommendation from a provider (&quot;MM card&quot;) on their developmental trajectories of frequent marijuana use and marijuana-related problems in young adulthood., METHODS: The analytic sample consists of young adult past month marijuana users (N = 671) who were part of a larger, diverse, and predominantly California cohort. Analyses are based on data from seven surveys completed from ages 13-19., RESULTS: At age 19, 28% of participants reported having an MM card to legally purchase marijuana from an MM dispensary. A multiple group latent growth model indicated that young adults who had an MM card showed steeper increases in frequent marijuana use (i.e., 20-30 days of use in the past month) from ages 13-19 compared to young adults who did not have an MM card. Logistic regression models that matched MM cardholders and non-MM cardholders on individual sociodemographic characteristics found that MM cardholders were more likely to report marijuana negative consequences, selling marijuana/hashish, and driving under the influence of marijuana in the past year. In addition, MM cardholders were more likely to have tried cutting down or quitting in the past 3-months., CONCLUSIONS: Among young adult marijuana users, those with an MM card had a higher risk profile for marijuana use and related problems compared to those without an MM card. Given expanding state legalization of MM, this issue warrants further attention.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite cannabis' new-found legality and availability, few studies have explored the profile of PwMS cannabis users and characteristics of their use, particularly in a state where cannabis is legal both for recreational and medicinal use. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate cannabis use among PwMS at a large academic multiple sclerosis (MS) clinic, specifically: (1) prevalence, (2) products used (e.g., cannabidiol vs DELTA9-tetrahydocannabinol), (3) symptom treatment, and (4) patient characteristics., METHODS: PwMS completed questions assessing personal opinions about cannabis use, characteristics of cannabis use, MS history, and sociodemographic details, as well as the self-reported disability-Patient Determined Disease Steps (PDDS), overall quality of life-the Patient Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS-10), and cognition-the Neuro-QoL ACGC v1.0 measures., RESULTS: Thirty-eight percent (n=96) of PwMS were current Cannabis users (CUs). Although there were no sociodemographic or clinical differences (p&lt;=0.05) between CUs and Non-Cannabis users (NUs), CUs had significantly higher median disability compared to NUs (PDDS=2vs. 1; p=0.02). Among CUs, 57% categorized their use as strictly medicinal. CUs reported using cannabis most often for pain and insomnia/poor sleep and experienced greater than 60% benefit/relief from cannabis use. Over 90% of respondents desire more research on cannabis for MS, and 74% indicated they would consider using cannabis for their MS., CONCLUSION: As cannabis legalization has impacted the variety of cannabis products available, there appears to be growing numbers of PwMS using cannabis, with this study's CUs reporting use of highly efficacious products with minimal side-effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The questionnaire ran for a 10-week period from March to May 2017. Participants were asked about their knowledge of the evidence for and against prescribing pharmaceutical-grade cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol, and their concerns about prescribing medicinal cannabinoids., RESULTS: In total, 88 doctors responded to the survey, with 55 completing all items (23 psychiatrists, 32 trainees). Overall, 54% of respondents would prescribe medicinal cannabinoids if it was legal to do so. Participants believed there was evidence for the use of cannabidiol and tetrahydrocannabinol in treating childhood epilepsy, chronic pain, and nausea and vomiting. They were most concerned about medicinal cannabinoids leading to psychotic symptoms, addiction and dependence, apathy and recreational use., CONCLUSIONS: Our sample of Australian psychiatrists and trainees were aware of the main clinical indications for medicinal cannabinoids, but were poor at differentiating between the indications for cannabidiol versus tetrahydrocannabinol. Further education about medicinal cannabinoids appears necessary.</abstract></record><record><database name="cannabisrefs.enl" path="cannabisrefs.enl">cannabisrefs.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Subritzky, Todd</author><author>Pettigrew, Simone</author><author>Lenton, Simon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Issues in the implementation and evolution of the commercial recreational cannabis market in Colorado.</title><secondary-title>The International journal on drug policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The International journal on drug policy</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2015</year></dates><pub-location>Netherlands</pub-location><electronic-resource-num>https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.drugpo.2015.12.001</electronic-resource-num><urls><web-urls><url>http://ovidsp.ovid.com/ovidweb.cgi?T=JS&amp;PAGE=reference&amp;D=medp&amp;NEWS=N&amp;AN=26777400</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>BACKGROUND: For almost a century, the cultivation, sale and use of recreational cannabis has been prohibited by law in most countries. Recently, however, under ballot initiatives four states in the US have legalised commercial, non-medical (recreational) cannabis markets. Several other states will initiate similar ballot measures attached to the 2016 election that will also appoint a new President. As the first state to implement the legislation in 2014, Colorado is an important example to begin investigating early consequences of specific policy choices while other jurisdictions consider their own legislation although the empirical evidence base is only beginning to accrue., METHOD: This paper brings together material sourced from peer reviewed academic papers, grey literature publications, reports in mass media and niche media outlets, and government publications to outline the regulatory model and process in Colorado and to describe some of the issues that have emerged in the first 20 months of its operation., RESULTS: These issues include tension between public health and profit, industry and investment, new methods of consumption, the black market and product testing., CONCLUSION: The paper concludes that, while it is too early to determine the impact of the scheme, and noting that it includes some features designed to mitigate adverse impacts, it faces major challenges. Not least of these are the lack of an effective overarching federal regulatory structure, as a consequence of the federal prohibition on cannabis, combined with a rapidly growing cannabis industry which, like other industries, will seek to exploit loopholes to maximise profit.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.
