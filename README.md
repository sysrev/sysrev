## Installation

- Install Nix: `sh <(curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install)`
  - See [macOS Installation](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/installation/installing-binary.html?highlight=macos#macos-installation-a-namesect-macos-installation-change-store-prefixaa-namesect-macos-installation-encrypted-volumeaa-namesect-macos-installation-symlinkaa-namesect-macos-installation-recommended-notesa) in case of issues
   - Configure Nix with `mkdir -p ~/.config/nixpkgs && echo "{allowUnfree=true;}" > ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix`
- Install Docker
  - The Clojure server needs to be able to start Docker containers. One way to allow this is to add its user to the `docker` group:
    - `sudo groupadd docker`
    - `sudo usermod âˆ’aG docker $USER`
- Get a copy of `vars.sh` from a developer and place it in the root of the repository
- Optionally install [direnv](https://direnv.net/) and [nix-direnv](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-direnv) (or [lorri](https://github.com/nix-community/lorri) for macOS). This allows you to leave out the `nix-shell --run` portion of commands.

## Usage

- Run VSCode with `nix-shell --run "bin/code"`
  - For emacs keybindings, first run `ln -s nix/vscode-emacs.nix local.nix`
  - For IntelliJ keybindings, first run `ln -s nix/vscode-intellij.nix local.nix`. You may import an IntelliJ keymaps XML file from within VSCode

- Run ClojureScript with `nix-shell --run "cd client && bash browser-repl"`

- Run dev server from VSCode with "Calva: Start a Project REPL and Connect" > "Sysrev Server"
  - Or run stand-alone dev server with `nix-shell --run "bash repl-in-mem"`
  - The server will listen on http://localhost:4061
  - The NRepl port number is written to `.nrepl-port`, if you want to connect with a different editor.

- Run tests with `nix-shell --run "bash scripts/test-local"`

## Initial Setup without Nix

1. Clone this repository

        git clone <yourname>@github.com:insilica/systematic_review.git sysrev
        cd sysrev

1. Install OpenJDK 8 (or Oracle release) via system package manager

1. Install [Leiningen](https://leiningen.org/)

1. Run project setup script

        ./setup.sh

    Follow instructions to install any missing dependencies on error, then run `setup.sh` again.

1. (Optional) Set up Nginx

    This isn't necessary for running a dev environment, but it will provide HTTP compression and replicate how the web server is set up on EC2.

    On Linux

    * Install Nginx via system package manager

    * Edit `nginx.conf` (`/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`) to include the following line:

            http {
              ...
              include /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/*;
              ...
            }

        And create the directory if needed:

            sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/sites-enabled

    * Link `sysrev.dev.nginx-site` into `sites-enabled`:

            sudo ln -s `pwd`/conf-files/sysrev.dev.nginx-site /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

    * Start Nginx process:

        (Linux systemd)

            sudo systemctl start nginx

            # and enable to start on boot

            sudo systemctl enable nginx

    On macOS

    * Install Nginx via homebrew

            brew install nginx

    * Link `sysrev.dev.nginx-site` into 'servers'

            cp conf-files/sysrev.dev.nginx-site /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/

    * Start Nginx service and restart at login

            brew services start nginx

            # if you would like to restart service

            brew services restart nginx

## Database Connection

You will need a connection to a copy of the Sysrev Postgres database in order to run the server app for development. The default configuration uses port 5432 on localhost. If that port is available, you can run the web app connecting to the database via an SSH tunnel to a database machine (builds.insilica.co) on port 5432.

There is a script included that can do this:

    ./scripts/open-tunnel ubuntu builds.insilica.co 5432 5432

To use a different port number, edit these files to change the value from 5432: `config/dev/config.edn`, `config/repl/config.edn`, `config/test/config.edn`

You can also clone a local copy of the database using `./scripts/clone-latest-db` with an SSH tunnel open to a source database (`clone-latest-db` pulls from port 5470 by default; you can edit the script to change 5470 to another value if needed).

## Dev Environment

* Create local database

    1. Install wget

            `brew install wget`

    1. Install flyway

            `./scripts/install-flyway`

    1. Create a postgresql super user account

       `psql> CREATE USER postgres;`
       `psql> ALTER USER postgres WITH SUPERUSER;`

    1. Open an SSH tunnel to Postgres on a machine with a copy of the database

    1. Edit `scripts/clone-latest-db` to set `PROD_TUNNEL_PORT` to the port of
       your SSH tunnel connection to the source machine.

    1. `$ bash -c 'SR_DEST_PORT=5432 SR_DEST_DB=sysrev ./scripts/clone-latest-db'`

    1. `$ createdb -O postgres -T sysrev sysrev_test`

* `./repl` (or `M-x cider-jack-in` in Emacs) should start a REPL for the server project.
  This should automatically connect to the database and run the HTTP server when started.

* `./figwheel` should start a ClojureScript browser REPL for the client project.

* Create a web user from the Clojure REPL

  `sysrev.user> (create-user "james@insilica.co" "test1234" :project-id 100)`

* When a route is changed, you must restart the web server

    `repl> (sysrev.init/start-app)`

* To manage database with Flyway:

    Edit `flyway.conf` to match database connection settings.

    Database name `sysrev` is used in production and REPL; `sysrev_test` is used by `lein test` and Jenkins build tests.

    Run `./flyway info` to check status of database relative to files in `./resources/sql/*.sql`.

    Run `./flyway migrate` to apply changes to database; you will want to apply changes to both `sysrev`
    and `sysrev_test` (edit `flyway.conf` to connect to each).

* Log in as any user

    Use the password 'override' to login as any user in dev environment

* AWS Credentials for dev environment

    Request the config.local.edn from a developer. Copy this file into config/dev/ and config/test/


## IDE Setup

* Cursive (IntelliJ)

* Cider (Emacs)

    * One of:
        * `M-x cider-connect` (connect to an external process started with `./repl` script)
        * `M-x cider-jack-in` (spawn `lein repl` process from Emacs)

### ClojureScript client setup

1. Start figwheel using the script in the command line

    `$ ./figwheel`

1. Open a web browser

1. Note the port with the line 'Figwheel: Starting nREPL server on port: 7888'
   (project.clj sets this to port 7888 by default)

1. M-x cider-connect (use localhost and port 7888)

    Note: You must be visiting a file that is in the root dir of
    the project in order for M-. to follow fn names properly.
    It is a good idea to run "cider-connect" while visiting project.clj
    in the root dir

1. In the repl, run

```clojure
user> (use 'figwheel-sidecar.repl-api)
user> (cljs-repl)
```

1. Verify that you are communicating with the browser by running

```clojurescript
cljs.user> (.log js/console "hi")
```

    You should see "hi" in the console

1. Switch to sysrev.user namespace

```clojurescript
cljs.user> (in-ns 'sysrev.user)
```

   This is a namespace which pulls in all other namespaces as a workshop ns

1. You can use the figwheel REPL to navigate to views with the nav fn

```clojurescript
sysrev.user> (nav "/create-project")
```

### Development

1. To update reframe data, that is defined by a def-data form,

```clojurescript
(dispatch [:fetch [:identity]])
```

2. def-action form defines post calls

3. Re-frame keeps all data in a  reframe.db/app-db reagent atom

   Explore it with

```clojurescript
(-> @re-frame.db/app-db keys)
```

   View data with a cursor

```clojurescript
(first @(reagent.core/cursor re-frame.db/app-db [:state :self :projects]))
```

#### Development Cycle

1. To pull data from the server, add a definition using `def-data` form

    ex: To make a GET request on the server, using term as a URL parameter, you would use:

```clojurescript
(def-data :pubmed-query
  :loaded? (fn [db search-term]
             (get-in db [:data :search-term search-term])
             ) ;; if loaded? is false, then data will be fetched from server, otherwise, no data is fetched. It is a fn of the dereferenced re-frame.db/app-db.
  :uri (fn [] "/api/pubmed/search") ;; uri is a function that returns a uri string
  :prereqs (fn [] [[:identity]]) ;; a fn that returns a vector of def-data entries
  :content (fn [search-term] {:term search-term}) ;; a fn that returns a map of http parameters (in a GET context)
  :process
  (fn [_ [search-term] {:keys [pmids]}]
    ;; [re-frame-db query-parameters (:result response)]
    (let [search-term-result (-> pmids :esearchresult :idlist)]
      {:dispatch-n
       (list [:pubmed/save-search-term-results search-term search-term-result])})))
```

1. Create a new event in state/<filename>.cljs for retrieving the data

```clojurescript
(reg-event-db
 :pubmed/save-search-term-results
 [trim-v]
 (fn [db [search-term search-term-response]]
   (assoc-in db [:data :search-term search-term]
             search-term-response)))
```

1. Read the data from the server in the REPL

```clojurescript
`sysrev.user> (dispatch [:fetch [:pubmed-query "foo bar"]])`
```

1. Check to see if the ajax request is ongoing,

```clojurescript
sysrev.user> (sysrev.data.core/loading? [:pubmed-query "foo bar"])
false
```

1. In state/ dir, find a relevant namespace or create a new one.

    If you create a new namespace, add it to sysrev.state.all

```clojurescript
(reg-sub
 :pubmed/search-term-result
 (fn [db [_ search-term]] ;; first term in the destructed term is the subscription name itself,
     e.g. [_ search-term] _ is :pubmed/search-term-result
   (-> db :data :search-term (get-in [search-term]))))
```

1. The subscription makes the db atom available like this:
```clojurescript
   sysrev.user> @(subscribe [:pubmed/search-term-result "foo bar"])
```

1. Create a new view in cljs/sysrev/views{/panels}
```clojurescript
(defn SearchPanel [state]
  "A panel for searching pubmed"
  (let [current-search-term (r/cursor state [:current-search-term])
        on-change-search-term (r/cursor state [:on-change-search-term])
        page-number (r/cursor state [:page-number])]
    (fn [props]
      (let []
        [:div.create-project
         [:div.ui.segment
          [:h3.ui.dividing.header
           "Create a New Project"]
          [SearchBar state]
          [PubmedSearchLink state]
          [SearchResult state]]]))))
```

1. If a new namespace was created, **add it to sysrev.views.main**

1. Add a method to panel-content so that the :set-active-panel event
   can be dispatched in routes.cljs (below)
```clojurescript
(defmethod panel-content [:create-project] []
  (fn [child]
    [SearchPanel state]))
```

1. Add a route for the view (if needed) to cljs/sysrev/routes.cljs
```clojurescript
(sr-defroute
 create-project "/create-project" []
 (dispatch [:set-active-panel [:create-project]]
           "/create-project"))
```

1. From the repl
---
<!-- 1. Define data in 'state/' -->

<!-- 1. Define data retrieval and handling using `def-data` form (from sysrev.data.core) -->

<!-- 1. Create or modify a reagent component in 'views/' -->

## Testing

Testing is done both locally and on our Jenkins continuous deployment server at builds.insilica.co.

## Fixing Remote Testing Issues

There are instances when remote tests will fail, but the tests pass locally. It can be difficult
to pinpoint what is actually causing the error without experiencing it yourself. Try:

1. Isolate the test and transform it into a plain (defn ...) function definition. This will
generally mean
    i. rename (deftest-browser failing-test ...) -> (defn failing-test [] ...)
    ii. deleting the initial lines regarding when to test and the test-user line
    iii. transforming the vector of local vars into a let block
    iv. manually inserting the :cleanup statements to the end of the block
2. Start the visual webdriver
   > (sysrev.test.browser.core/start-visual-webdriver)
3. Run the tests multiple times to trigger a failure
   > (dotimes [n 10] (failing-test))

## Config Files

The Clojure project uses https://github.com/yogthos/config for loading config profiles.

Config files for different profiles are kept in `config/<profile>/config.edn`.

The documentation includes ways for overriding those values locally.

## Project Structure

* `project.clj`

### Server Project

* TODO: put something here

### Client Project

[re-frame](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame) provides the core structure for the app (state management and rendering). The [re-frame documentation](https://github.com/Day8/re-frame/tree/master/docs#introduction) has a set of documents covering the rationale and use of all the core concepts (subscriptions, events, views, etc.)

The root path for ClojureScript code is `src/cljs/sysrev`. Shared client/server `.cljc` code is included from `src/cljc/sysrev`. Source paths written below are generally relative to these root paths.

#### Convention for naming of subscriptions/events

By convention for this project, auto-namespaced keywords (prefaced by `::` rather than `:`) are used for re-frame subscriptions and events that are intended to be used only in the current namespace (analogous to namespace-local functions defined using `defn-`).

Subscriptions and events defined with ordinary globally-scoped keywords (`:get-something`) or custom-namespaced keywords (`:project/labels`) present a public interface to the rest of the project. They should aim not to duplicate similar functionality provided by other interfaces, and should avoid exposing incidental details of implemention or data formatting.

#### Organization of functionality

General-use functionality for data access and event handling is kept under `state/`. For functionality specific to a single UI component, the subscriptions and events should be kept in `views/` inside the file that implements rendering the component.

#### File layout structure

* `user.cljs`
    * Namespace for use in REPL. Imports symbols from all other namespaces for convenience
* `state/`
    * re-frame subscriptions and events intended for general use
* `data/`
    * Defines data entries fetched via GET requests from server
    * `sysrev.data.core` implements a system for defining these
    * `def-data` forms are defined in source files with relevant functionality
* `action/`
    * Defines server interaction actions for POST requests
    * `sysrev.action.core` implements a system for defining these (similar to `sysrev.data.core`)
    * `def-action` forms are defined in source files with relevant functionality
* `routes.cljs`
    * Contains all route handler definitions
* `views/`
    * Contains all rendering code, and state management code which is specific to a UI component
    * `views/panels/`
        * Defines rendering handlers for all routes in the app
        * Generally organized using a separate file for each route

### AWS Files

* `./scripts/server/` contains scripts that are used on the EC2 web/database server
* `./scripts/server/systemd/` contains systemd services

## Browser Tests

The test suite (run with `lein test`) includes browser tests using Selenium with headless Chrome. The `chromedriver` executable must be available via `$PATH`; it should be included in your system package for Chromium or Chrome, or in an additional system package.

## UI Tests

You can run UI tests standalone with the the command `cd client && bash run-front-end-tests`. This will rebuild the app and run test which can be slow.

For a faster feedback loop, run the front-end build script, then run from another terminal `npx karma start --single-run --reporters junit,dots`. This will run the same test suite, but will test against the currently running version of the app. You can update tests in real-time and re-run the script.

# DB Restore

You can populate your local sysrev database with the one from a recent backup.

### Pull the backup

```
$ scripts/pull-latest-db
```

This will download the most recent backup file the form sysrev-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.pgdumpc to the current directory

### Restore Backup

To restore the backup

```
$ scripts/restore-from-dump -d sysrev -f sysrev-2019-12-08_06-31-10.pgdumpc
SR_BACKUP_FILE: sysrev-2019-12-08_06-31-10.pgdumpc

## Adding Site Admins

The easiest way to add site admins is to have them create an insilica.co account. Then, on sysrev.com update the user's account:

```
update web_user set permissions = '{"admin"}' where email = 'user@insilica.co';
```
## GraphQL API

SysRev has an experimental GraphQL API. It is tightly coupled to the Datasource GraphQL API.
It is recommended to use the GraphiQL tool to experiment with both APIs, the curl examples are
given as a guide for when programmatically interacting with the API.

## Import articles into a project

1. Generate a GraphQL query for obtaining the appropriate entities from Datasource. Currently, only entities
   that have text-like mimetypes such as xml or json are supported. You must request the id, external_id and content
   for the entity

   Here is a query which will obtain entities form the HSDB dataset from Datasource and return their xml content:
   `{entitiesByExternalIds(dataset:5,externalIds:["12","8499","8498"]) { id external_id content}}`

   This query can be directly used in the GraphiQL tool. Here is an example of retrieving it using curl:

```bash
$ curl https://datasource.insilica.co/graphql --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Authorization:Bearer <datasource-api-key>" \
-d '{"query": "{entitiesByExternalIds(dataset:5,externalIds:[\"12\",\"8499\",\"8498\"]) { id external_id content}}"}'
```
Note: the dataset id for HSDB is 5

Now, to add these to a project with ID of 102

**REQUEST**
```bash
curl https://sysrev.com/graphql --header "Content-Type: application/json" --header "Authorization:Bearer <sysrev-api-token>" \
-d '{"query": "mutation M{importArticles(id:102,query:\"{entitiesByExternalIds(dataset:5,externalIds:[\\\"12\\\",\\\"8498\\\",\\\"8499\\\"]){id,external_id,content}}\")}"}'
```

**RESPONSE**
```bash
{"data":{"importArticles":true}}
```

Note: externalIds are strings, though in this example the string values correspond to integers. Integer externalId values are not guaranteed.
      There is triple \ in front of the external ids to escape the strings inside of the query argument!

To generate such a string in Clojure
```clojure
> (venia/graphql-query {:venia/operation {:operation/type :mutation :operation/name "M"}
    :venia/queries [[:importArticles {:id 102 :query (venia/graphql-query
    {:venia/queries [[:entitiesByExternalIds {:dataset 5 :externalIds ["12" "8498" "8499"]} [:id :external_id :content]]]})}]]})

"mutation M{importArticles(id:102,query:\"{entitiesByExternalIds(dataset:5,externalIds:[\"12\",\"8498\",\"8499\"]){id,external_id,content}}\")}"
```
