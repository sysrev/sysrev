     "Our study is aimed to know if tele-rehabilitation could improve the motor function and general condition in post-stroke patients who are in isolation or quarantine of serious infection issues.",
     :DetailedDescription
     "Background: Most post stroke patients suffer from poor motor recovery and difficulty in performing activities of daily living. Early intervention has better prognosis for those patients. However, patients may miss the prime of rehabilitation due to an interruption of regular rehabilitation programs, which is caused by the infection control policies for Covid-19 or other serious infection issues. Tele-rehabilitation could be a substitution of regular rehabilitation, by which post-stroke patients in out-ward clinics and nursing facilities could have functional improvement in upper limbs motions, ADLs and complex activities. Furthermore, there is no evidence yet of the effectiveness in tele-rehabilitation during the isolation or quarantine of serious infection issues.\n\nPurposes: This study is aimed to know if tele-rehabilitation could improve the motor function and general condition in post-stroke patients who are in isolation or quarantine of serious infection issues. Moreover, the application of tele-rehabilitation in post-stroke patients will be discussed in this study.\n\nMethods: Post-stoke patients would be recruited from a hospital of a medical university in Northern Taiwan. They will be divided into experimental group (tele-rehabilitation) (N=10) and control group (bedside rehabilitation) (N=10). Each patient will go on a treatment with 10 sections, and each section is 15 or 30 minutes. A single-blinded evaluator will do the pre- and post-evaluation during the treatment. The evaluations include Postural Assessment Scale for Stroke Patients (PASS), Functional ambulation category (FAC), Modified Barthel index (MBI), Patient health questionnaire-9 (PHQ9), Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). In the end, a satisfaction questionnaire will be given.\n\nData analysis: Nonparametric test will be used in the comparison of the pre- and post-evaluation data inter group. The analysis will be carried out using SPSS Statistic (v20.0) and α<0.05.\n\nKey words: tele-rehabilitation, stroke, infection, isolation, quarantine"},

    {:BriefSummary
     "Participants will be allocated to one of two experimental groups using a blocked randomization method; participants will be randomized within blocks such that an equal number are assigned to each treatment. Allocation proceeds by randomly selecting one of the orderings and assigning the next block of participants to study groups according to the specific sequence. Once participants are allocated to one block, each block will be randomly assigned to one of the two interventions. Participants will be randomly divided into one of two blocks, each containing a maximum of 75 participants. Possible treatment allocations within each block are (1) AABB, (2) BBAA, (3) ABAB, etc. This method ensures equal treatment allocation within each block. Each participant will then be assigned a number that will represent the participants' block as well as the participants' individual participant ID number (i.e., Participant '100-123' would be in the same group as participant '100-124'). Groups will be assigned using an Excel file to input participants into subsequent groupings and keep track of questionnaire submissions. At baseline, purpose-questionnaires will be distributed to both groups to assess history and experience with vaping and measure intention to vape less along with the \"baseline self-reported questionnaires\" that will be administered on Day 1 to all participants. At Day 7 (T1), respective participants will be emailed the attached video link and questionnaires and be instructed to complete the surveys after watching the participants' respective videos. The study intervention will be a single site trial delivered as a video link to the email provided by the participant; both intervention videos will play on YouTube and participants will be instructed to complete the surveys immediately after watching the video attached to the email sent to the participants. The participants will complete self-reported questionnaires at 3 follow-up periods after baseline in the 6-week protocol (all questionnaires will be sent by the student investigator (SI) to the email provided by the participants). Self-reported vaping behaviour questionnaires will be managed at baseline, Day 7 (T1), Day 30 (T2), and Day 45 (T3).",
     :DetailedDescription
     "Participants will be allocated to one of two experimental groups using a blocked randomization method; participants will be randomized within blocks such that an equal number are assigned to each treatment. Allocation proceeds by randomly selecting one of the orderings and assigning the next block of participants to study groups according to the specific sequence. Once participants are allocated to one block, each block will be randomly assigned to one of the two interventions. Participants will be randomly divided into one of two blocks (A or B), each containing a maximum of 75 participants. Possible treatment allocations within each block are (1) AABB, (2) BBAA, (3) ABAB, etc. This method ensures equal treatment allocation within each block. Each participant will then be assigned an ID number that will represent the participnats' block as well as the participants' individual participant ID number (i.e., Participant '100-123' would be in the same group as participant '100-124'). Participants will be provided the participants' ID number via email by the SI when the LOI/C is signed by the study team and sent back to the participant. Groups will be randomly allocated to an intervention group and an Excel file will be used to organize participants into subsequent groupings and keep track of questionnaire submissions. Since the total number of participants is 150, the investigators chose the block randomization method to assign groups equally because it is short enough to prevent imbalance and long enough to prevent guessing allocation in trials. Within the study timeline, the investigators plan to implement the block randomization schema following pre-screening and informed consent processing. To avoid the presence of stratification errors the investigators further plan to review the allocation design before administering study intervention and purpose-questionnaires to prevent participant mismanagement during the protocol. At baseline, purpose-questionnaires will be distributed to both groups to assess the participants' history and experience with vaping and measure the participants' intention to vape less along with the \"baseline self-reported questionnaires\" that will be administered on Day 1 to all participants. At Day 7 (T1), respective participants will be emailed an attached video link and the questionnaires and be instructed to complete the surveys immediately after watching the video. The study intervention will be a single site trial delivered as a video link to the email provided by the participant; both intervention videos will play on YouTube. The participants will complete self-reported questionnaires at 3 follow-up periods after baseline in the 6-week protocol (all questionnaires will be sent by the student investigator (SI) to the email provided by the participants). Self-reported vaping behaviour questionnaires will be managed at baseline, Day 7 (T1), Day 30 (T2), and Day 45 (T3). All interventions will be created using the Qualtrics Survey Software and will be distributed to the email provided by the individual participants.\n\nThe Protection motivation theory is a theory that helps to clarify fear appeals. The protection motivation theory proposes that the participants choose to commit to certain behaviours for self-protection based on four factors: the perceived severity of a threatening event, the perceived probability of the occurrence, or vulnerability, the efficacy of the recommended preventive behaviour, and the perceived self-efficacy. Within the study design, participant groups are one of two treatment conditions: PMT present or PMT absent (attention control). The PMT present group will include an 8-minute informational video that explains the current research and health risks associated with vaping, within the context of a threat appraisal focus (Perceived Vulnerability and Perceived Severity). During this video intervention, the severity of vaping among young adult populations, incorporating both the short and long-term health effects will be presented. In addition, the negative impact of vaping and the lack of research and information that currently exists on popular vaping products will be brought to light, including the potentially devastating impact it can have on the health of young adults. The PMT absent group will feature an 8-minute nutrition and lifestyle information video as an attention control strategy in this study. During this video intervention, the general risks and benefits of nutrition and lifestyle choices will be presented. The focus of this video will be on how a balanced diet and proper lifestyle choices (i.e., adequate sleep) can benefit the participants lives in the short-term and long-term. In regard to lifestyle choices, the topic of substance abuse will be discussed briefly but without depth or research. The reason for the nutrition and lifestyle information group control intervention is because it provides informative lifestyle choices that can help promote the participants overall health without having an underlying link to vaping behaviour, separating and illustrating the impact of the specific information provided by the threat appraisal PMT, compared to general nutrition and lifestyle advice on overall vaping intention and behaviour of a Canadian student population of mostly young adults. Within the study procedures, the investigators acknowledge the potential impact retrospective questionnaires may have on participants; in the study design the investigators expect there to be a change in intention to vape as a result of the intervention, specifically in the PMT group, however, the investigators do not expect the questionnaires alone to cause statistically significant change to participant behaviour-intention or action-behaviour.\n\nIf the Principal Investigator (PI) and Student Investigator (SI) determine safe behaviour is not being practiced and/or the participant is not in a stable psychological state, the SI will email the respective participant(s) privately and explain that the participants should only continue to participate in this study if the participants feel safe and psychologically sound. The contact information of a clinical psychologist, Dr. Lisa Lee, and the Counselling Service of London, specialized in anxiety therapy and self-esteem counselling, both as part of the study team, will be included in this email or provided to participants upon request, along with the Center for Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) distress phone number. The role of Dr. Lee and the Counselling Service of London are to work as a mental health resource for participants in cases that the PI and SI deem the participant is not practicing safe behaviour/in a stable psychological state and in circumstances where the participant requests additional aid from the study team. All participants will also be reminded to contact the participants' respective university health centre resources. In extreme cases, if the SI and PI recognize a participant is continuing to not practice safe behaviour or maintain a stable psychological state, the participant will be withdrawn from study participation and the contact information for Dr. Lee, the Counselling Services of London, and the CAMH distress line will be provided to the participant again, advising the participants to call, email, or text the health and wellness centre for additional aid."},

    {:BriefSummary
     "The American Academy of Pain Medicine has labeled pain as a \"silent epidemic\" due to its staggering costs to society (over $500 billion/year) and widespread prevalence (affects over 100 million Americans)(Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Advancing Pain Research, 2011; Summers B, 2005). Thus, it is imperative to test and validate cost-effective pain therapies.\n\nTo this extent, cannabis is characterized as one of the most promising therapies to treat a wide spectrum of pain conditions (Andreae et al., 2015; Baker, Pryce, Giovannoni, & Thompson, 2003; Bostwick, 2014; Haroutounian et al., 2016; Shohet, Khlebtovsky, Roizen, Roditi, & Djaldetti, 2017). However, the clinical applicability of cannabis-based pain therapies has been limited due to lacking mechanistic characterization in human-focused studies. Of critical importance, the neural mechanisms supporting cannabis induced pain relief remain unknown. The primary objective of the proposed pilot study is to identify the brain mechanisms supporting the direct alleviation of acutely evoked pain through vaporized cannabis.",
     :DetailedDescription
     "Behavioral (visual analog scale) and neural (cerebral blood flow) effects of a \"medium\" dose (5.1% THC by weight; NIDA supply; University of Mississippi) of vaporized cannabis in response to a well-validated noxious heat stimulation (49°C) and an emerging fMRI perfusion technique (arterial spin labeling) will be conducted when compared to placebo (<.1% THC/weight). Cannabis will be self-administered using a portable Volcano vaporizer -a safe and reliable method of intrapulmonary administration of cannabinoids and the Foltin Uniform Puff Procedure (FUPP), an established inhalation protocol commonly used in cannabis research to reduce variability of dosing across subjects.\n\nDuration of Human Involvement Successful completion of the proposed study will include a total of 2 sessions. Prior to their enrollment potential subjects will first be screened over the phone to determine if they qualify for the proposed project. There may be up to 2 weeks between a subject's initial screening and their official enrollment of the study.\n\nA14-day gap between enrollment and the first experimental session will be provided time to enroll cohorts, group randomization, and individualized scheduling. Once the schedules have been determined, the subjects' baseline assessment and baseline testing session will be scheduled, and a study coordinator(s) will schedule the pharmacologic testing sessions. The sessions can include weekends; this approach will increase study feasibility, compliance and adherence.\n\nPlanned Data Collection\n\nData Collection:\n\nThe following information will be collected from all subjects: name, date of birth, age, gender, ethnicity, telephone number email address, handedness, current/previous drug and cannabis regimen.\n\nAll of the proposed procedures are characterized as \"experimental\".\n\nStudy Session 1: Subjects will first report to the ACTRI. After obtaining informed consent, If subjects are female and of child-bearing age (<55 years), they will be administered a urine based pregnancy test. Participants will also take a cannabis focused urine screening. Research technicians will be employed to determine participant eligibility based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria, including reviewing MRI screening eligibility. These criteria will simply be based on self-report and assessment of medical history from their respective physicians, on an \"as needed\" basis. After meeting study inclusion criteria, subjects will then be administered and complete one pre-session study questionnaires and will be trained to reliably use the visual analog scale (VAS) to rate their pain.\n\nPsychophysical Testing\n\nThermal stimulation: As in all of our prior IRB approved experiments, the MEDOC TSA-II will be used to deliver all thermal stimuli. All stimulus temperatures will be less than or equal to 50°C, and volunteers will be free to escape the stimulator at any time. No stimulus will produce tissue damage. This study will use a 16x16 mm surface area for the delivery of neutral and noxious stimuli. This modest stimulus area allows a relatively wide range of noxious stimuli to be delivered (up to 50°C for 30 seconds) without either tissue damage or significant subject withdrawals/drop-outs. Stimuli in this temperature range have been used extensively by the PI and numerous laboratories around the world and do not produce tissue damage or burns. In order to facilitate removal from the stimulator, the stimulator will be attached to a custom-designed thermal stimulation probe holder. Participants will place their calf on top of the probe holder and will not be strapped in or otherwise restrained. Therefore, participants will be able to simply lift their legs at any time.\n\nCannabis administration\n\nCannabis will be stored in a locked and alarmed freezer in a UCSD research pharmacy until it is dispensed to the subjects. Each subject will be provided a lock box in which to store the capsules assigned to them.\n\nThese drugs are not FDA-approved for the proposed subject population and purpose. The IND for the proposed study is in preparation and will be submitted pending IRB approval.\n\nStudy Drug: Bulk cannabis from the following NIDA batches will be purchased from the NIDA supply at the University of Mississippi. The cannabis supply from NIDA/University of Mississippi varies in the exact percentages available from year to year. Numerous past UCSD/CMCR studies have used the NIH/NIDA supply.\n\nTHC dominant (THC ~5.1%, CBD <0.1%, \"THC\")\nPlacebo cannabis (THC <0.1%, \"Placebo\")\n\nStudy treatments will be administered under direct observation by a study nurse using a cued-inhalation procedure. Subjects will be given verbal instructions prior to initiation of the procedure. The respective dose of cannabis or placebo will be aerosolized using the VOLCANO-System-Vaporizer (VSV). The VSV releases the active ingredients of the cannabis through vaporization by hot air. The vapor with active ingredients of the cannabis are trapped in a bag. A mouthpiece attached to the bag allows for inhalation. The subject will be seated in a chair in the designated smoking room (in the ACTRI) and will be given the bag containing aerosolized cannabis. The study nurse/research technician will provide verbal cues from an adjacent room. The nurse will instruct the subject to inhale for 5 seconds. The subject will then be instructed to remove the mouthpeice from the lips and hold the inhalation for 5 seconds (if possible). Next, the subject will be instructed to exhale fully. The subject will be given a 40-second resting period until the process is repeated up to 3 more times, at which time it is expected that the cannabis content of the bag will be fully depleted.\n\nOnly study physicians, research pharmacist and the research coordinator will be able to identify the cannabis dosage. This will be a double blinded study.\n\nExperimental Sessions: All of the proposed procedures are characterized as \"experimental\".\n\nSession 1: This session will serve as the baseline control.\n\nSubjects will first report to the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (pressurized clinical room).\nAfter obtaining informed consent, research technicians will confirm participant eligibility based on our inclusion and exclusion criteria. Then, if female participants are of child-bearing age, they will be administered a urine-based pregnancy test.\nWeight will be measured to identify the appropriate drug dosage\nOnce eligibility criteria review is complete, the research technician will begin the psychophysical training and baseline pain testing portion of the session.\nParticipants will be trained to reliably use the visual analog scale (VAS) to rate their pain and introduced to the thermal stimuli. Participants will be familiarized with 32, 5s duration stimuli (35 - 49°C) using the MEDOC TSA-II and use of the VAS (Zeidan, Emerson, et al., 2015; Zeidan, Lobanov, et al., 2015a; Zeidan et al., 2011). Stimuli will be delivered to the back of the right calf as subjects lie in supine.\nWe will then assess baseline psychophysical responses to noxious heat by administering a total of four heat series. Heat series (4min and 24s) include ten, alternating 12s plateaus of 49°C and 35°C stimulation to the back of the right calf. The thermal probe will be moved to a different region on the back of the right calf after completion of the first heat series. VAS pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings will be collected after each series.\nIn the first two heat series, subjects will be instructed to \"try to stay still\". We will then instruct them to sit quietly for 10 minutes to control for the time elapsed in the subsequent heat testing-fMRI experimental sessions (Experimental Session 2 ).\nAfter 10 minutes pass, two heat series will be administered.\nAfter successful completion of sensory testing, participants will then complete study questionnaires (see Questionnaires for Study Assessments).\nRandomization will occur after successful completion of study session 1.\n\nParticipant Randomization:\n\nRandomization will be tracked in the Screening/Enrollment Log that is maintained by the study coordinator(s). Randomization will be stratified so that each sex will have their respective list of randomization codes.\n\nMales and females will be randomized without replacement across a block of 120 codes (assuming 20% attrition) using an Excel-based random number generator. Subjects will then be randomized to one of two groups (5% THC/weight vs. <.1% THC/weight). The study coordinator is responsible for enrolling, scheduling, and randomizing subjects.\n\nGroup randomization\n\nTHC 5.1% group • Fifty subjects will receive a \"medium\" dose (5.1% THC by weight; NIDA supply; University of Mississippi) of vaporized cannabis\n\nTHC .1% placebo group\n\n• Fifty subjects will receive a \"very low\" dose (<.1% THC by weight; NIDA supply; University of Mississippi) of vaporized cannabis\n\nThe following procedures will be performed in each group, respectively.\n\nSession 2: After at least 2 days have elapsed, subjects will report back to the ACTRI to complete study session 2. Data collection in this session will take no more than 1.5 hour to complete.\n\nA research technician will greet subjects as they arrive to the ACTRI and guide them to the pressurized room.\nACTRI nurses will then administer a cannabis based drug screening.\nWeight will be measured to confirm the prescribed drug dosage.\nNext, the research technician will issue study assessments to the subject (via REDCap).\nSubjects will then be positioned in the scanner.\nA respiratory transducer will be fitted across the chest.\nRest: Subjects will be instructed to keep their eyes closed and to reduce movement.Heat series (4min and 24s) that contain ten, alternating 12s plateaus of 49°C and 35°C stimulation to the back of the right calf. Two heat series will be administered during fMRI acquisition. VAS pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings are collected after each series. The thermal probe will be moved to a different location of the right calf after each heat series to reduce potential habituation and sensitization. Subjects will be instructed not to move and to keep their eyes closed.\nVaporized cannabis administration: Subjects will then be escorted to a pressurized room in the ACTRI. Subjects will be administered vaporized cannabis by inhaling aerosolized cannabis through the Volcano vaporizer. The study nurse/research technician will provide verbal cues from an adjacent room. The nurse will instruct the subject to inhale for 5 seconds. The subject will then be instructed to remove the mouthpeice from the lips and hold the inhalation for 5 seconds (if possible). Next, the subject will be instructed to exhale fully. The subject will be given a 40-second resting period until the process is repeated up to 3 more times and/or until the content of the bag is fully depleted.\nAfter 10 minutes of cannabis administration, will reposition said subject in the MRI Scanner.\nTwo more heat series will be administered during fMRI acquisition. VAS ratings will be assessed after each heat series.\nWe will then acquire a structural scan.\n\nOutcome Measure(s):\n\nCerebral blood flow (average blood perfusion; mL blood/100 grams tissue/minute): changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) will be assessed during arterial spin labeling and BOLD fMRI.\nVisual Analog Scale (VAS): Pain ratings will be assessed in response to the noxious heat stimulation. Pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale. The minimum rating (\"0\") is designated as \"no pain\" whereas the maximum (\"10\") is labeled as \"most intense imaginable\" or \"most unpleasant imaginable.\" Higher numbers correspond to higher pain.\n\nRespiration Rate (Biopac respiratory transducer): Changes in respiration rate could be predictive of analgesia and health promotion. We will be able to identify, in real-time, if respiration rate data is being appropriately collected. Thus, there will be no need to adjudicate these data.\n\nQuestionnaires for Study Assessments:\n\nAll questionnaires will be delivered using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) platform on iPAD tablets administered and supervised by study personnel. The questionnaires to be presented on the REDCap platform include the following:\n\nProfile of Mood States Questionnaire (POMS-short form): This is a 40-item measure of 6 mood states: tension-anxiety, depression-dejection, anger-hostility, vigor-activity, fatigue-inertia, and confusion-bewilderment. This assessment is recommended by the IMMPACT group as a core measure of emotional functioning.\nSubjects' Global Impression of Change (PGIC): This is a self-report assessment recommended to evaluate self-reported perception of improvement over trial/efficacy of treatment.\nPROMIS 29-Item Profile: This is a 29-item generic health-related survey that assesses the following 7 domains: depression, anxiety, physical function, pain interference, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and ability to participant in social roles/activities.\nState Anxiety Inventory (SAI): The SAI is a prominent 20-item measure for anxiety, and will be utilized as a manipulation check for our behavioral interventions.\nSF-12 Health Survey (SF-12): This is a 12-item version of the SF-36 item Health Survey designed to assess general mental and physical functioning, and overall health-related quality of life.\nBeck Depression Inventory (BDI): This is a 21-item standard assessment widely used to measure clinical depression.\nPittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): This is a 10-item assessment designed to measure quality of sleep.\nCohen Perceived Stress Scale (PSS): This assessment is critical for controlling stress in our analyses as well as a potential predictor in clinical pain improvements\nPositive and Negative Affect Scale (PANAS): This is a 20-item self-report assessment used to assess positive and negative affect in a subject.\nUNCOPE: This is a 6-item scale that provides a simple and quick means of identifying risk for abuse and dependence for alcohol and other drugs\nCannabis Use Disorders Identification Test (CUDIT): screens for current cannabis use disorders (abuse or dependence) according to DSM-IV\nProblematic Use of Marijuana (PUM): measures ICD-10 harmful use along with problems in interpersonal relationships and psycho-physical functioning.\nCannabis Abuse Screening Test (CAST) identifies patterns of cannabis use leading to negative consequences on a social or health level for the user himself or others.\nBowdle questionnaire: This questionnaire evaluates 3 psychedelic effects (drug high, alterations in internal perception, and alterations in external perception) from 13 questions scored on a 100-mm visual analogue scale (from 0, no effect, to 100, maximum effect). Internal perception reflects inner feelings that do not correspond with the reality and is derived from questions regarding the hearing of unrealistic voices or sounds and having unrealistic thoughts and paranoid or anxious feelings. The external perception indicates a misperception of an external stimulus or change in the awareness of the subject's surroundings and is derived from questions regarding the perceptual change of body parts, the change of surroundings, the altered passing of time, the difficulty of controlling thoughts, and the change in color and sound intensity.\n\nSample Size Determination & Power:\n\nAt this stage, the proposed study is exploratory in nature. Neverthelesss, random effects models require a sample of 15 - 20 participants per group to attain sufficient statistical power to detect a large effect size in fMRI-based regression models. We have repeatedly found that sample sizes 15-16 (per group) can reliably detect the neural correlates of pain relief across multiple fMRI testing points. However, since individual differences in pain sensitivity and between group comparisons could decrease the power to assess relatively small differences in neural activation across time, we will recruit 100 participants (50 per group) to test our hypotheses. The data collected in this pilot study will also be used to estimate the effect sizes to help design a larger fully-powered follow-up trial.\n\nData Analyses and Interpretation:\n\nAge and sex will be entered as covariates in all appropriate analyses. As previously, VAS pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings will be examined in separate analyses. To test study hypotheses, a 2 (group: medium dose vs. placebo) X 2 (rest vs. cannabis/placebo) repeated measures (RM) ANOVA will be employed. Post-hoc paired samples t-tests (in each group) will be conducted to test significant main effects and interactions on behavioral and neural responses. Pain ratings derived from Session 1 may be entered as covariates. Between groups differences on exploratory outcomes (psychological assessments) will be assessed with a 2 (group) X 2(pre vs. post) RM ANOVA.\n\nInclusion of Women and Minorities: Subjects will include all sexes and races. We plan to screen from over 2500 subjects from the ACTRI's recruitment service, 11 separate providers, and the local community. Based on prior work, we will target to recruit 54% Non-Hispanic White, 15% Non-Hispanic Black, 17% Hispanic, 7% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1% Native American/American Indian, and 6% Other. If necessary to obtain minority representation, under-represented racial groups will be targeted specifically for recruitment.\n\nGeneral Considerations:\n\nData for all individual subjects randomized or exposed to study drug will be presented in data listings. Continuous data will be summarized using the following descriptive summary statistics: the number of subjects (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), standard error (SE), median, minimum value (min), and maximum value (max). Categorical data will be summarized using counts and percentages."},

    {:BriefSummary
     "The prevalence of smoking in the homeless population (70%) is over 4 times that of the general population (15%). Homeless adults have not experienced similar declines in tobacco use as the general population has over the past three decades. Homeless adults are interested in smoking cessation and make quit attempts, but are less successful in quitting smoking than the general population. Trials of group behavioral counseling and pharmacotherapy for smoking cessation have not led to substantial long-term abstinence (i.e., abstinence for 6 months or more), suggesting that these interventions alone are insufficient to improve quit rates among homeless adults. Many homeless adults seek health care in safety net clinics; these clinics could bring cessation interventions to scale. Contingency management is a powerful behavior change intervention that reinforces positive health behaviors through the provision of modest incentives (e.g., cash). In this pilot randomized controlled trial, the investigator will test the feasibility and acceptability of a contingency management intervention that provides incentives for smoking cessation for people experiencing homelessness.",
     :DetailedDescription
     "In this pilot RCT, the investigator will (1) adapt a known-efficacious extended CM cessation intervention to a novel population and setting, with the ultimate goal of increasing long-term abstinence among homeless adults seeking care in safety net health clinics, (2) develop a corresponding RCT protocol, and (3) conduct a pilot RCT to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the RCT. If the pilot RCT is feasible and acceptable, the investigator will test the adapted intervention in a subsequently-funded, full-scale RCT.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\nAssess feasibility and acceptability of a CM intervention through:\n\nMeasuring biochemically-verified point prevalence abstinence at 6 months follow-up.\nMeasuring participant adherence to the protocol.\nGathering information on the number of visits attended.\nAssessing the retention protocol.\n\nSecondary Objectives\n\nAssess feasibility and acceptability of a CM intervention through:\n\nBiochemically-verified 7-day point months follow-up at 3 months.\nProlonged abstinence at 3 months and 6 months follow-up.\nPoint-prevalent abstinence at 12 months"},

     :DetailedDescription
     "TAS2940 is a small molecule inhibitor of ERBB family proteins HER2 and EGFR. It has not been evaluated in human subjects yet. The study will be conducted in 2 parts, dose escalation and dose expansion. The dose escalation part will assess the safety and determine the maximum tolerated dose, the recommended phase 2 dose and the recommended dosing regimen of TAS2940 administered orally. The dose expansion part will assess preliminary anti-tumor activity in select solid tumors characterized by HER2 or EGFR aberrations."},

    {:BriefSummary
     "This study is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI on residual GGOs after surgery in patients with multiple primary lung cancers with ground glass nodules. This study is expected to prove that compared with placebo in the control group, EGFR-TKI can significantly reduce the residual GGOs lesions in patients with EGFR-positive multiple primary lung cancers with ground-glass opacity, and bring a higher objective response rate (ORR), thus provides new insights for treatment of these patients.",
     :DetailedDescription
     "Lung cancer is one of the most deadly malignant tumors in the world. It is estimated that 0.2-20% of lung cancer patients have multiple primary lung cancers at the time of diagnosis, and many of them present with multiple ground glass opacities. The surgical method for such multiple lesions depends on their number, anatomical location and size, as well as the age and pulmonary function of the patient. It is easily affected by the subjective judgment of the surgeon. Besides, many of these patients develop multiple lesions that cannot be resected at the same time, and there haven't been established a standard therapy for residual GGO lesions after surgery.\n\nAccording to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, EGFR-TKI is recommended for the adjuvant treatment of stage IB-ⅢA NSCLC with EGFR mutations. However, it is not clear whether EGFR-TKI is effective for multiple primary lung cancers or the residual GGOs after surgical resection of the EGFR mutation positive main cancers. At present, there have been retrospective studies showing that application of EGFR-TKIs targeted therapy can significantly reduce the diameter of residual GGOs after surgery resection of EGFR mutation-positive primary lesions for MPLC patients, and reduce the secondary surgery caused by the progression of the lesion. However, there is no prospective Studies confirming the efficacy and safety of EGFR-TKI on these postoperative residual GGOs lesions.\n\nThis study is a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, comparative clinical research. This study plans to enroll 138 patients with multiple primary lung cancers (cTis-T1c, N0, M0) that manifest GGO and cannot be resected at the same time, patients should have undergone surgical resection of the EGFR mutated main lesion, and have no less than 1 GGO lesion remaining after surgery. Eligible patients will be randomly divided into the treatment group (receiving furmonertinib mesilate tablets) or control group (placebo) at a ratio of 1:1. The grouping process was strictly double-blind for both the investigators and subjects. By collecting the relevant data of patients' baseline images, pathology, and follow-up images during treatment, statistical analysis is used to evaluate the effectiveness (response rate, objective remission rate), safety, and relevant influencing factors (including CTR value of the main lesion, number of residual lesions, diameter of the largest residual lesion, higher stage of the main lesion, residual lesion's density, etc.) of EGFR-TKI treatment.\n\nThis study is expected to prove that compared with the placebo in the control group, EGFR-TKI can significantly reduce the diameter of residual GGO lesions in patients with EGFR-positive multiple primary lung cancers with ground-glass density, and bring a higher objective response rate (ORR) but did not significantly increase the incidence of adverse effects."},

    {:BriefSummary
     "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that occurs with the effect of dopaminergic pathways in the substantia nigra and causes a progressive decrease in motor functions. When the literature is examined; Physiotherapy and rehabilitation programs applied in PD include conventional physiotherapy methods and neurophysiological based activity training. Classical physiotherapy programs; It includes stretching, strengthening, aerobics, posture exercises, balance and coordination training. PH treatment in recent years; Virtual reality is gradually enriched with motor imagery and robot-assisted physiotherapy applications and different exercise methods including dance, music therapy, yoga, pilates and spinal stabilization exercises.\n\nStabilization exercises, which form the basis of spinal stabilization training, use the basic principles of motor learning. The aim of the spinal stabilization exercise program is to support the vertebral column by increasing the strength and endurance of the stabilizer muscles, to improve the spinal posture by increasing kinesthetic awareness and to improve balance control.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of telerehabilitation practices even more. Telerehabilitation can be defined as providing rehabilitation services remotely using information and communication technologies. In order to minimize the risk of transmission in the COVID-19 pandemic, physical activity levels of individuals have been reduced by restricting social life and the access of sick individuals to rehabilitation services is severely restricted. In addition, rehabilitation professionals are at risk in the treatment of these patients due to the serious transmission risk of COVID-19. Considering these situations, it is emphasized by many authorities that telerehabilitation practices should be expanded.\n\nInactivity, which occurs as a result of restrictions in access to social isolation and rehabilitation services, brought about by the COVID-19 Pandemic in Parkinson's patients, adversely affects the progression of the disease. Telerehabilitation allows patients who cannot access rehabilitation due to their geographical, economic or physical disabilities to benefit from rehabilitation services. It is known that telerehabilitation applied in various neurological diseases reduces the fatigue levels of the patients, improves their functional activities and quality of life.\n\nIn line with all these reasons, this study was planned to investigate the effectiveness of two different exercise programs adapted to the telerehabilitation program in Parkinson's patients during the Covid 19 pandemic."},
